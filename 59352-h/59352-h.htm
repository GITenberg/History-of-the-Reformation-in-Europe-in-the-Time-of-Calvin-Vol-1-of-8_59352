<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">At</span> the conclusion of the preface to the first
volume of the <i>History of the Reformation</i>, the
author wrote, ‘This work will consist of four volumes,
or at the most five, which will appear successively.’
These five volumes have appeared. In them are
described the heroic times of Luther, and the effects
produced in Germany and other countries by the
characteristic doctrine of that reformer&mdash;justification
by faith. They present a picture of that great
epoch which contained in the germ the revival of
christianity in the last three centuries. The author
has thus completed the task he had assigned himself;
but there still remained another.</p>

<p>The times of Luther were followed by those of
Calvin. He, like his great predecessor, undertook to
search the Scriptures, and in them he found the
same truth and the same life; but a different character
distinguishes his work.</p>

<p>The renovation of the individual, of the Church,
and of the human race, is his theme. If the Holy
Ghost kindles the lamp of truth in man, it is (according
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
to Calvin) ‘to the end that the entire man should
be transformed.’&mdash;‘In the kingdom of Christ,’ he says,
‘it is only the new man that flourishes and has any
vigour, and whom we ought to take into account.’</p>

<p>This renovation is, at the same time, an enfranchisement;
and we might assign, as a motto to
the reformation accomplished by Calvin, as well as to
apostolical christianity itself, these words of Jesus
Christ: <i>The truth shall make you free.</i><a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>When the gods of the nations fell, when the Father
which is in heaven manifested Himself to the world in
the Gospel, adopting as His children those who received
into their hearts the glad tidings of reconciliation with
God, all these men became brethren, and this fraternity
created liberty. From that time a mighty transformation
went on gradually, in individuals, in families, and
in society itself. Slavery disappeared, without wars or
revolutions.</p>

<p>Unhappily, the sun which had for some time gladdened
the eyes of the people, became obscured; the
liberty of the children of God was lost; new human
ordinances appeared to bind men’s consciences and
chill their hearts. The Reformation of the sixteenth
century restored to the human race what the middle
ages had stolen from them; it delivered them from
the traditions, laws, and despotism of the papacy; it
put an end to the minority and tutelage in which
Rome claimed to keep mankind for ever; and by calling
upon man to establish his faith not on the word of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">vii</span>
a priest, but on the infallible Word of God, and by
announcing to everyone free access to the Father
through the new and saving way&mdash;Christ Jesus, it
proclaimed and brought about the hour of christian
manhood.</p>

<p>An explanation is, however, necessary. There are
philosophers in our days who regard Christ as simply
the apostle of political liberty. These men should
learn that, if they desire liberty outwardly, they
must first possess it inwardly. To hope to enjoy the
first without the second is to run after a chimera.</p>

<p>The greatest and most dangerous of despotisms is
that beneath which the depraved inclination of human
nature, the deadly influence of the world, namely, sin,
miserably subjects the human conscience. There are,
no doubt, many countries, especially among those
which the sun of christianity has not yet illumined,
that are without civil liberty, and that groan under the
arbitrary rule of powerful masters. But, in order to
become free outwardly, men must first succeed in
being free inwardly. In the human heart there is a
vast country to be delivered from slavery&mdash;abysses
which man cannot cross alone, heights he cannot climb
unaided, fortresses he cannot take, armies he cannot
put to flight. In order to conquer in this moral
battle, man must unite with One stronger than himself&mdash;with
the Son of God.</p>

<p>If there is anyone, in the present state of society,
who is fatigued with the struggle and grieved at finding
himself always overcome by evil, and who desires
to breathe the light pure air of the upper regions of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
liberty&mdash;let him come to the Gospel; let him seek for
union with the Saviour, and in his Holy Spirit he
will find a power by which he will be able to gain
the greatest of victories.</p>

<p>We are aware that there are men, and good men
too, who are frightened at the word ‘liberty;’ but
these estimable persons are quite wrong. Christ is
a deliverer. <i>The Son</i>, He said, <i>shall make you free</i>.
Would they wish to change Him into a tyrant?</p>

<p>There are also, as we well know, some intelligent
men, but enemies of the Gospel, who, seeing a long
and lamentable procession of despotic acts pass before
them in the history of the Church, place them unceremoniously
to the account of christianity. Let them
undeceive themselves: the oppression that revolts
them may be pagan, jewish, papal, or worldly ... but
it is not christian. Whenever christianity reappears
in the world, with its spirit, faith, and primitive life, it
brings men deliverance and peace.</p>

<p>The liberty which the Truth brings is not for individuals
only: it affects the whole of society. Calvin’s
work of renovation, in particular, which was doubtless
first of all an internal work, was afterwards destined
to exercise a great influence over nations. Luther
transformed princes into heroes of the faith, and
we have described with admiration their triumphs at
Augsburg and elsewhere. The reformation of Calvin
was addressed particularly to the people, among
whom it raised up martyrs until the time came when
it was to send forth the spiritual conquerors of the
world. For three centuries it has been producing,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">ix</span>
in the social condition of the nations that have received
it, transformations unknown to former times. And
still at this very day, and now perhaps more than
ever, it imparts to the men who accept it a spirit of
power which makes them chosen instruments, fitted
to propagate truth, morality, and civilisation to the
ends of the earth.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The idea of the present work is not a new one:
it dates more than forty years back. A writer,
from whom the author differs on important points,
but whose name is dear to all who know the simple
beauty of his character, and have read with care his
works on the history of the Church and the history
of Dogmas, which have placed him in the foremost rank
among the ecclesiastical historians of our day&mdash;the
learned Neander&mdash;speaking with the author at Berlin
in 1818, pressed him to undertake a <i>History of the
Reformation of Calvin</i>. The author answered that
he desired first to describe that of Luther; but that
he intended to sketch successively two pictures so
similar and yet so different.</p>

<p>The <i>History of the Reformation in Europe in the
time of Calvin</i> naturally begins with Geneva.</p>

<p>The Reformation of Geneva opens with the fall of a
bishop-prince. This is its characteristic; and if we
passed over in silence the heroic struggles which led
to his fall, we should expose ourselves to just reproaches
on the part of enlightened men.</p>

<p>It is possible that this event, which we are called
upon to describe (the end of an ecclesiastical state),
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">x</span>
may give rise to comparisons with the present times;
but we have not gone out of our way for them. The
great question, which occupies Europe at this moment,
also occupied Geneva at the beginning of the sixteenth
century. But that portion of our history was written
before these late exciting years, during which the important
and complex question of the maintenance or
the fall of the temporal power of the popes has come
before, and is continually coming before, sovereigns
and their people. The historian, while relating the
facts of the sixteenth century, had no other prepossessions
than those which the story itself called up.</p>

<p>These prepossessions were quite natural. Descended
from the huguenots of France, whom persecution drove
from their country in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, the author had become attached to that
hospitable city which received his forefathers, and in
which they found a new home. The huguenots of
Geneva captivated his attention. The decision, the
sacrifices, the perseverance, and the heroism, with
which the Genevans defended their threatened liberty,
moved him profoundly. The independence of a city,
acquired by so much courage and by so many privations,
perils, and sufferings, is, without doubt, a sacred
thing in the eyes of all; and no one should attempt to
rob her of it. It may be that this history contains
lessons for the people, of which he did not always think
as he was writing it. May he be permitted to point
out one?</p>

<p>The political emancipation of Geneva differs from
many modern revolutions in the fact that we find
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">xi</span>
admirably combined therein the two elements which
make the movements of nations salutary; that is to
say, order and liberty. Nations have been seen in
our days rising in the name of liberty, and entirely
forgetting right. It was not so in Geneva. For
some time the Genevans persevered in defending the
established order of things; and it was only when they
had seen, during a long course of years, their prince-bishops
leaguing themselves with the enemies of the
state, conniving at usurpations, and indulging in acts
contrary to the charters of their ancestors, that they
accepted the divorce, and substituted a new state of
things for the old one, or rather returned to an
antecedent state. We find them always quoting
the ancient <i>libertates</i>, <i>franchesi&aelig;</i>, <i>immunitates</i>, <i>usus</i>,
<i>consuetudines civitatis Gebennensis</i>, first digested into
a code in 1387, while their origin is stated in the
document itself to be of much greater antiquity.
The author (as will be seen) is a friend of liberty;
but justice, morality, and order are, in his opinion,
quite as necessary to the prosperity of nations. On
that point he agrees with that distinguished writer on
modern civilisation, M. Guizot, though he may differ
from him on others.</p>

<p>In writing this history we have had recourse to
the original documents, and in particular to some
important manuscripts; the manuscript registers of
the Council of Geneva, the manuscript histories of
Syndic Roset and Syndic Gautier, the manuscript of
the <i>Mamelus</i> (Mamelukes), and many letters and remarkable
papers preserved in the Archives of Geneva.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">xii</span>
We have also studied in the library of Berne some
manuscripts of which historians have hitherto made
little or no use; a few of these have been indicated in
the notes, others will be mentioned hereafter. Besides
these original sources, we have profited by writings
and documents of great interest belonging to the sixteenth
century, and recently published by learned
Genevese arch&aelig;ologists, particularly by MM. Galiffe,
Grenus, Revillod, E. Mallet, Chaponi&egrave;re, and Fick.
We have also made great use of the memoirs of the
Society of History and Arch&aelig;ology of Geneva.</p>

<p>With regard to France, the author has consulted
various documents of the sixteenth century, little
or altogether unknown, especially in what concerns
the relations of the French government with the German
protestants. He has profited also by several
manuscripts, and by their means has been able to
learn a few facts connected with the early part of
Calvin’s life, which have not hitherto been published.
These facts are partly derived from the Latin letters
of the reformer, which have not yet been printed either
in French or Latin, and which are contained in the
excellent collection which Dr. Jules Bonnet intends
giving to the world, if such a work should receive
from the christian public the encouragement which
the labour, disinterestedness, and zeal of its learned
editor deserve.</p>

<p>The author having habitual recourse to the French
documents of the sixteenth century, has often introduced
their most characteristic passages into his text.
The work of the historian is neither a work of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">xiii</span>
imagination, like that of the poet, nor a mere conversation
about times gone by, as some writers of our day
appear to imagine. History is a faithful description
of past events; and when the historian can relate them
by making use of the language of those who took part
in them, he is more certain of describing them just as
they were.</p>

<p>But the reproduction of contemporary documents
is not the only business of the historian. He must
do more than exhume from the sepulchre in which
they are sleeping the relics of men and things of
times past, that he may exhibit them in the light of
day. We value highly such a work and those who
perform it, for it is a necessary one; and yet we do
not think it sufficient. Dry bones do not faithfully
represent the men of other days. They did not live
as skeletons, but as beings full of life and activity.
The historian is not simply a resurrectionist: he
needs&mdash;strange but necessary ambition&mdash;a power that
can restore the dead to life.</p>

<p>Certain modern historians have successfully accomplished
this task. The author, unable to follow them,
and compelled to present his readers with a simple and
unassuming chronicle, feels bound to express his admiration
for those who have thus been able to revive
the buried past. He firmly believes that, if a history
should have truth, it should also have life. The events
of past times did not resemble, in the days when they
occurred, those grand museums of Rome, Naples,
Paris, and London, in whose galleries we behold
long rows of marble statues, mummies, and tombs.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">xiv</span>
There were then living beings who thought, felt,
spoke, acted, and struggled. The picture, whatever
history may be able to do, will always have less of
life than the reality.</p>

<p>When an historian comes across a speech of one of
the actors in the great drama of human affairs, he
ought to lay hold of it, as if it were a pearl, and
weave it into his tapestry, in order to relieve the
duller colours and give more solidity and brilliancy.
Whether the speech be met with in the letters or
writings of the actor himself, or in those of the
chroniclers, is a matter of no importance: he should
take it wherever he finds it. The history which
exhibits men thinking, feeling, and acting as they
did in their lifetime, is of far higher value than those
purely intellectual compositions in which the actors
are deprived of speech and even of life.</p>

<p>The author, having given his opinion in favour of
this better and higher historical method, is compelled
to express a regret:

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Le <i>pr&eacute;cepte</i> est ais&eacute;, mais l’art est difficile.<br /></span>
</span></span>

And as he looks at his work, he has to repeat with
sorrow the confession of the poet of antiquity: <i>Deteriora
sequor!</i></p>

<p>This work is not a biography of Calvin, as some may
imagine. The name of that great reformer appears,
indeed, on the title-page, and we shall feel a pleasure,
whenever the opportunity occurs, in endeavouring to
restore the true colours to that figure so strangely misunderstood
in our days. We know that, in so doing,
we shall shock certain deeply-rooted prejudices, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">xv</span>
shall offend those who accept without examination, in
this respect, the fables of Romish writers. Tacitus
indeed assures us that malignity has a false show of
liberty: <i>Malignitati falsa species libertatis inest</i>; that
history is listened to with more favour when she slanders
and disparages: <i>Obtrectatio et livor pronis auribus
accipiuntur</i>. But what historian could entertain the
culpable ambition of pleasing at the expense of truth?
Moreover, we believe that, if our age still labours under
great errors with respect to many men and things,
it is more competent than those which went before to
hear the truth, to examine, appreciate, and accept it.</p>

<p>We repeat, however, that it is not a history of Calvin,
but of the Reformation in Europe in the time of that
reformer which we desire to narrate. Other volumes
are already far advanced, and we hope to publish
two more in the ensuing year. But may we be permitted,
in conclusion, to transcribe here a passage of
Holy Scripture that has often occurred to our mind in
executing a new work? It is this:</p>

<p><i>Ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what
is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a
little time, and then vanisheth away. For that ye ought
to say, If the Lord will, we shall live and do this or
that.</i><a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Facts</span> alone do not constitute the whole of history,
any more than the members of the body form the
complete man. There is a soul in history as well as
in the body, and it is this which generates, vivifies,
and links the facts together, so that they all combine
to the same end.</p>

<p>The instant we begin to treat of Geneva, which,
through the ministry of Calvin, was to become the
most powerful centre of Reform in the sixteenth
century, one question starts up before us.</p>

<p>What was the soul of the Reformation of Geneva?
Truly, salvation by faith in Christ, who died to save&mdash;truly,
the renewal of the heart by the word and the
Spirit of God. But side by side with these supreme
elements, that are found in all the Reformations, we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
meet with secondary elements that have existed in
one country and not in another. What we discover
at Geneva may possibly deserve to fix the attention
of men in our own days: the characteristic element
of the Genevese Reform is liberty.</p>

<p>Three great movements were carried out in this
city during the first half of the sixteenth century.
The first was the conquest of independence; the
second, the conquest of faith; the third, the renovation
and organisation of the Church. Berthelier,
Farel, and Calvin are the three heroes of these three
epics.</p>

<p>Each of these different movements was necessary.
The bishop of Geneva was a temporal prince like the
bishop of Rome; it was difficult to deprive the bishop
of his pastoral staff unless he were first deprived of
his sword. The necessity of liberty for the Gospel
and of the Gospel for liberty is now acknowledged by
all thoughtful men; but it was proclaimed by the
history of Geneva three centuries ago.</p>

<p>But it may be said, a history of the Reformation
has no concern with the secular, political, and social
element. I have been reproached with not putting
this sufficiently forward in the history of the Reformation
of Germany, where it had relatively but little
importance. I may perhaps be reproached with
dwelling on it too much in the Reformation of Geneva,
where it holds a prominent place. It is a hard matter
to please all tastes: the safest course is to be guided
by the truth of principles and not by the exigencies
of individuals. Is it my fault if an epoch possesses
its characteristic features? if it is impossible to keep
back the secular, without wronging the spiritual, element?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
To cut history in two is to distort it. In
the Reform of Geneva, and especially in the constitution
of its church, the element of liberty predominates
more than in the Reforms of other countries.
We cannot know the reason of this unless we study
the movement which gave birth to that Reform. The
history of the political emancipation of Geneva is interesting
of itself; liberty, it has been said,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> has never
been common in the world; it has not flourished
in all countries or in all climates, and the periods
when a people struggles <i>justly</i> for liberty are the
privileged epochs of history. One such epoch occurred
at the commencement of modern times; but strange
to say, it is almost in Geneva alone that the struggles
for liberty make the earlier decades of the sixteenth
century a privileged time.</p>

<p>It is in this small republic that we find men remarkable
for their devotion to liberty, for their attachment
to law, for the boldness of their thoughts, the
firmness of their character, and the strength of their
energy. In the sixteenth century, after a repose of
some hundreds of years, humanity having recovered
its powers, like a field that had long lain fallow, displayed
almost everywhere the marvels of the most
luxuriant vegetation. Geneva is indeed the smallest
theatre of this extraordinary fermentation; but it was
not the least in heroism and grandeur, and on that
ground alone it deserves attention.</p>

<p>There are, however, other reasons to induce us to
this study. The struggle for liberty in Geneva was
one of the agents of its religious transformation;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
that we may know one, we must study the other.
Again, Calvin is the great man of this epoch; it is
needful, therefore, to study the country where he
appeared. A knowledge of the history of Geneva
before Calvin can alone enable us to understand
the life of this great reformer. But there remains
a third and more important reason. I am about to
narrate the history of the Reformation of the sixteenth
century in the time of Calvin. Now, what chiefly distinguishes
the Reformation of Calvin from that of
Luther is, that wherever it was established, it brought
with it not only truth but liberty, and all the great developments
which these two fertile principles carry
with them. Political liberty, as we shall see, settled
upon those hills at the southern extremity of the Leman
lake where stands the city of Calvin, and has never
deserted them since. And more than this: earthly
liberty, the faithful companion of divine truth, appeared
at the same time with her in the Low Countries,
in England, in Scotland, and subsequently in
North America and other places besides, everywhere
creating powerful nations. The Reformation of Calvin
is that of modern times; it is the religion destined for
the whole world. Being profoundly spiritual, it subserves
also in an admirable manner all the temporal
interests of man. It has the <i>promise of the life that
now is, and of that which is to come</i>.</p>

<p>The free institutions of Protestant countries are not
due solely to the Reformation of Calvin: they spring
from various sources, and are not of foreign importation.
The elements of liberty were in the blood of
these nations, and remarkable men exerted a civilising
influence over them. Magna Charta is older than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
the Genevese Reform; but we believe (though we
may be mistaken) that this Reformation has had
some small share in the introduction of those constitutional
principles, without which nations can never
attain their majority. Whence did this influence
proceed?</p>

<p>The people of Geneva and their great doctor have
each left their stamp on the Reformation which issued
from their walls: Calvin’s was truth, the people’s,
liberty. This last consideration compels us to narrate
the struggles of which Geneva was the theatre, and
which, though almost unknown up to the present hour,
have aided, like a slender brook, to swell the great
stream of modern civilisation. But there was a second
and more potent cause. Supreme among the great
principles that Calvin has diffused is the sovereignty
of God. He has enjoined us to <i>render unto C&aelig;sar the
things that are C&aelig;sar’s</i>; but he has added: ‘God must
always retain the sovereign empire, and all that
may belong to man remains subordinate. Obedience
towards princes accords with God’s service; but if
princes usurp any portion of the authority of God, we
must obey them only so far as may be done without
offending God.’<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> If my conscience is thoroughly
subject to God, I am free as regards men; but if I
cling to anything besides heaven, men may easily
enslave me. True liberty exists only in the higher
regions. The bird that skims the earth may lose it at
any moment; but we cannot ravish it from the eagle
who soars among the clouds.</p>

<p>The great movements in the way of law and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
liberty effected by the people in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries, have certain relations with
the Reformation of Calvin, which it is impossible
to ignore.</p>

<p>As soon as Guy de Br&egrave;s and many others returned
from Geneva to the Low Countries, the great contest
between the rights of the people and the revolutionary
and bloody despotism of Philip II. began; heroic
struggles took place, and the creation of the United
Provinces was their glorious termination.</p>

<p>John Knox returned to his native Scotland from
Geneva, where he had spent several years; then
popery, arbitrary power, and the immorality of a
French court made way in that noble country for that
enthusiasm for the gospel, liberty, and holiness, which
has never since failed to kindle the ardent souls of its
energetic people.</p>

<p>Numberless friends and disciples of Calvin carried
with them every year into France the principles
of civil and political liberty;<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> and a fierce struggle
began with popery and the despotism, of the Valois
first, and afterwards of the Bourbons. And though
these princes sought to destroy the liberties for which
the Huguenots shed their blood, their imperishable
traces still remain among that illustrious nation.</p>

<p>The Englishmen who, during the bloody persecution
of Mary, had sought an asylum at Geneva imbibed
there a love for the gospel and for liberty. When they
returned to England, a fountain gushed out beneath
their footsteps. The waters confined by Elizabeth
to a narrow channel, rose under her successors and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
swiftly became an impetuous roaring flood, whose
insolent waves swept away the throne itself in their
violent course. But restored to their bed by the wise
hand of William of Orange, the dashing torrent sank
into a smiling stream, bearing prosperity and life
afar.</p>

<p>Lastly, Calvin was the founder of the greatest of
republics. The ‘pilgrims’ who left their country in
the reign of James I., and, landing on the barren
shores of New England, founded populous and
mighty colonies, are his sons, his direct and legitimate
sons; and that American nation which we have
seen growing so rapidly boasts as its father the humble
reformer on the shores of the Leman.</p>

<p>There are, indeed, writers of eminence who charge
this man of God with despotism; because he was the
enemy of libertinage, he has been called the enemy of
liberty. Nobody was more opposed than Calvin to
that moral and social anarchy which threatened the
sixteenth century, and which ruins every epoch unable
to keep it under control. This bold struggle of Calvin’s
is one of the greatest services he has done to liberty,
which has no enemies more dangerous than immorality
and disorder.</p>

<p>Should the question be asked, How ought infidelity
to be arrested? we must confess that Calvin was
not before his age, which was unanimous, in every
communion, for the application of the severest punishments.
If a man is in error as regards the knowledge
of God, it is to God alone that he must render
an account. When men&mdash;and they are sometimes
the best of men&mdash;make themselves the avengers of
God, the conscience is startled, and religion hides her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
face. It was not so three centuries back, and the
most eminent minds always pay in one manner or
another their tribute to human weakness. And yet,
on a well-known occasion, when a wretched man,
whose doctrines threatened society, stood before the
civil tribunals of Geneva, there was but one voice in
all Europe raised in favour of the prisoner; but one
voice that prayed for some mitigation of Servetus’s
punishment, and that voice was Calvin’s.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p>However inveterate the prejudices against him may
be, the indisputable evidence of history places Calvin
among the fathers of modern liberty. It is possible
that we may find impartial men gradually lending
their ear to the honest and solemn testimony of past
ages; and the more the world recognises the importance
and universality of the Reformation which came
forth from Geneva, the more shall we be excused for
directing attention for a few moments to the heroic
age of this obscure city.</p>

<p>The sixteenth century is the greatest in Christian
times; it is the epoch where (so to speak) everything
ends and everything begins; nothing is paltry, not
even dissipation; nothing small, not even a little city
lying unobserved at the foot of the Alps.</p>

<p>In that renovating age, so full of antagonist forces
and energetic struggles, the religious movements did
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
not proceed from a single centre; they emanated from
opposite poles, and are mentioned in the well-known
line&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Je ne d&eacute;cide pas entre Gen&egrave;ve et Rome.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Catholic focus was in Italy&mdash;in the metropolis
of the ancient world; the evangelical focus
in Germany was transferred from Wittemberg to the
middle of European nations&mdash;to the smallest of cities&mdash;to
that whose history I have to relate.</p>

<p>When history treats of certain epochs, as for instance
the reign of Charles V., there may be a certain
disadvantage in the vastness of the stage on which
the action passes; we may complain that the principal
actor, however colossal, is necessarily dwarfed. This
inconvenience will not be found in the narrative I
have undertaken. If the empire of Charles V. was the
largest theatre in modern history, Geneva was the
smallest. In the one case we have a vast empire,
in the other a microscopical republic. But the
smallness of the theatre serves to bring out more
prominently the greatness of the actions: only
superficial minds turn with contempt from a sublime
drama because the stage is narrow and the
representation devoid of pomp. To study great
things in small is one of the most useful exercises.
What I have in view&mdash;and this is my apology&mdash;is
not to describe a petty city of the Alps, for that
would not be worth the labour; but to study in that
city a history which is in the main a reflection of the
history of Europe,&mdash;of its sufferings, its struggles, its
aspirations, its political liberties, and its religious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
transformations. I will confess that my attachment
to the land of my birth may have led me to examine
our annals rather too closely, and narrate them at too
great length. This attachment to my country which
has cheered me in my task, may possibly expose me to
reproach; but I hope it will rather be my justification.
‘This book,’ said Tacitus, at the beginning
of one of his immortal works, ‘was dictated by
affection: that must be its praise, or at least its
excuse.’<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> Shall we be forbidden to shelter ourselves
humbly behind the lofty stature of the prince of
history?</p>

<p>Modern liberties proceed from three different
sources, from the union of three characters, three
laws, three conquests&mdash;the Roman, the German, and
the Christian. The combination of these three influences,
which has made modern Europe, is found in
a rather striking manner in the valley of the Leman.
The three torrents from north, south, and east, whose
union forms the great stream of civilisation, deposited
in that valley which the Creator hollowed out between
the Alps and the Jura that precious sediment whose
component parts can easily be distinguished after
so many ages.</p>

<p>First we come upon the Roman element in Geneva.
This city was for a long while part of the empire;
‘it was the remotest town of the Allobroges,’ says
C&aelig;sar.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> About a league from Geneva there once
stood an antique marble in honour of Fabius Maximus
Allobrogicus, who 122 years before Christ had triumphed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
over the people of this district;<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> and the great Julius
himself, who constructed immense works round the
city, bequeathed his name to a number of Roman
colonists, or clients at least. More remarkable traces&mdash;their
municipal institutions&mdash;are found in most
of the cities which the Romans occupied; we may be
permitted to believe that Geneva was not without
them.</p>

<p>In the fifth century the second element of modern
liberties appeared with the Germans. The Burgundians&mdash;those
Teutons of the Oder, the Vistula, and
the Warta&mdash;being already converted to Christianity,
poured their bands into the vast basin of the Rhone,
and a spirit of independence, issuing from the distant
forests of the north, breathed on the shores of the
Leman lake. The Burgundian tribe, however, combined
with the vigour of the other Germans a milder
and more civilising temperament. King Gondebald
built a palace at Geneva; an inscription placed fifteen
feet above the gate of the castle, and which remains
to this day, bears the words, <i>Gundebadus rex clementissimus</i>,
&amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> From this castle departed the
king’s niece, the famous Clotilda, who, by marrying
Clovis, converted to Christianity the founder of the
French monarchy. If the Franks then received the
Christian faith from Geneva, many of their descendants
in the days of Calvin received the Reformation from
the same place.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span></p>

<p>Clotilda’s uncle repaired the breaches in the city
walls, and having assembled his ablest counsellors,
drew up those Burgundian laws which defended small
and great alike, and protected the life and honour of
man against injury.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></p>

<p>The first kingdom founded by the Burgundians
did not, however, last long. In 534 it fell into the
hands of the Merovingian kings, and the history of
Geneva was absorbed in that of France until 888,
the epoch when the second kingdom of Burgundy
rose out of the ruins of the majestic but ephemeral
empire of Charlemagne.</p>

<p>But long before the invasion of the Burgundians in
the fifth century, a portion of Europe, and Geneva in
particular, had submitted to another conquest. In the
second century Christianity had its representatives in
almost every part of the Roman world. In the time of
the Emperor Marcus Aurelius and of Bishop Iren&aelig;us
(177) some persecuted Christians of Lyons and Vienne,
in Dauphiny, wishing to escape from the flames and the
wild beasts to which Rome was flinging the children of
God, and desirous of trying whether their pious activity
could not bear fruit in some other soil, had
ascended the formidable waters of the Rhone, and,
coming to the foot of the Alps&mdash;refuge and refugees
are of old date in this country&mdash;brought the gospel
thither, as other refugees, coming also from Gaul, and
also fleeing their persecutors, were fourteen centuries
later to bring the Reformation. It seems they were
only disciples, humble presbyters and evangelists, who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
in the second and third century first proclaimed the
divine word on the shores of the Leman; we may
therefore suppose that the Church was instituted in
its simplest form. At least it was not until two centuries
later, in 381, that Geneva had a bishop, Diogenes,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>
and even this first bishop is disputed.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> Be
that as it may, the gospel which the refugees brought
into the valley lying between the Alps and the Jura,
proclaimed, as it does everywhere, the equality of all
men before God, and thus laid the foundations of its
future liberties.</p>

<p>Thus were commingled in this region the generating
elements of modern institutions. C&aelig;sar, Gondebald,
and an unknown missionary represent, so to
speak, the three strata that form the Genevese soil.</p>

<p>Let us here sketch rapidly a few salient points of
the ancient history of Geneva. The foundations upon
which a building stands are certainly not the most
interesting part, but they are perhaps the most necessary.

<span class="small">FIRST USURPATIONS AND FIRST STRUGGLES.</span></h2>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Geneva</span> was at first nothing but a rural township
(<i>vicus</i>), with a municipal council and an edile.
Under Honorius in the 4th century it had become
a city, having probably received this title after
Caracalla had extended the rights of citizenship to all
the Gauls. From the earliest times, either before or
after Charlemagne, Geneva possessed rights and liberties
which guaranteed the citizens against the despotism
of its feudal lord. But did it possess political institutions?
was the community organised? Information
is wanting on these points. In the beginning of
the sixteenth century the Genevese claimed to have
been free so long that <i>the memory of man runneth not
to the contrary</i>.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> But this ‘memory of man’ might
not embrace many centuries.</p>

<p>The pope having invited Charlemagne to march
his Franks into Italy, for the <i>love of God</i>, and to
fight against his enemies, that prince proceeded thither
in 773 with a numerous army, part of which crossed
Mount St. Bernard, thus pointing the way to another
Charlemagne who was to appear a thousand years
later, and whose empire, more brilliant but still
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
more ephemeral than the first, was also in its dissolution
to restore liberty to Geneva, which had been a
second time absorbed into France.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> Charlemagne,
while passing through with his army, halted at
Geneva and held <i>a council</i>.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> This word has led to
the belief that the city possessed <i>liberties</i> and <i>privileges</i>,
and that he confirmed them;<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> but the council was
probably composed of the councillors around the prince,
and was not a city council. Be that as it may, the
origin of the liberties of Geneva seems to be hidden in
the night of time.</p>

<p>Three powers in their turn threatened these liberties.</p>

<p>First came the counts of Geneva. They were
originally, as it would seem, merely officers of the
Emperor;<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> but gradually became almost independent
princes.</p>

<p>As early as 1091, we meet with an Aymon, count of
Genevois.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> The rule of these counts of Genevois
soon extended over a wide and magnificent territory.
They resided not only at their hereditary manor-seat
in Geneva, which stood on the site of Gondebald’s
palace, but also in various castles scattered in distant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
parts of their domain&mdash;at Annecy, Rumilly, La Roche,
Lausanne, Moudon, Romont, Rue, Les Cl&eacute;es, and other
places.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> In those days, the counts lived both a solitary
and turbulent life, such as characterised the feudal
period. At one time they were shut up in their
castles, which were for the most part surrounded by a
few small houses, and begirt with fosses and drawbridges,
and on whose walls could be seen afar the arms
of the warders glittering in the rising sun. At other
times, they would sally forth, attended by a numerous
escort of officers, with their seneschal, marshal, cup-bearers,
falconers, pages, and esquires, either in pursuit
of the chase on the heights of the Jura and the
Alps; or it might be with the pious motive of visiting
some place of pilgrimage; or not unfrequently indeed
to wage harassing crusades against their neighbours
or their vassals. But during all these feudal agitations
another power was growing in Geneva&mdash;a power
humble indeed at first&mdash;but whose mouth was to
<i>speak great things</i>.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<p>At the period of the Burgundian conquest Geneva
possessed a bishop, and the invasion of the Germans
soon gave this prelate considerable power. Gifted with
intelligence far superior to that of the men by whom
they were surrounded, respected by the barbarians as
the high-priests of Rome, knowing how to acquire vast
possessions by slow degrees, and thus becoming the
most important personages in the cities where they resided,
the bishops laboured to protect their city from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
abroad and to govern it at home. Finally they confiscated
without much ceremony the independence of
the people, and united the quality of prince with that
of bishop.</p>

<p>In 1124 Aymon, Count of Genevois, by an agreement
made with Humbert of Grammont, Bishop
of Geneva, gave up the city to the latter,<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> reserving
only the old palace and part of the criminal jurisprudence,
but continuing to hold the secondary towns
and the rural district.</p>

<p>The institution of bishop-princes, half religious and
half political, equally in disaccord with the Gospel of
past ages and the liberty of the future, may have been
exceptionally beneficent; but generally speaking it
was a misfortune for the people of the middle ages,
and particularly for Geneva. If at that time the
Church had possessed humble but earnest ministers
to hold up the light of the Gospel to the world, why
should not the same spiritual power, which in the
first century had vanquished Roman polytheism, have
been able in later times to dispel the darkness of
feudalism? But what could be expected of prelates
who turned their croziers into swords, their
flocks into serfs, their pastoral dwellings into fortified
castles? <i>Corruptio optimi pessima.</i> The prince-bishop,
that amphibious offspring of the barbaric
invasion, cannot be maintained in christendom. The
petty people of Geneva&mdash;and this is one of its titles
to renown&mdash;was the first who expelled him in modern
times; and the manner in which it did this is
one of the pages of history we desire to transcribe.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
It needed truly a powerful energy&mdash;the arm of
God&mdash;to undertake and carry through this first
act which wrested from episcopal hands the temporal
sceptre they had usurped. Since then the
example of Geneva has often been followed; the
feudal thrones of the bishops have fallen on the
banks of the Rhine, in Belgium, Bavaria, Austria,
and elsewhere; but the first throne that fell was that
of Geneva, as the last will be that of Rome.</p>

<p>If the bishop, owing to the support of the emperors,
succeeded in ousting the count from the city
of Geneva, leaving him only the jurisdiction over
his rural vassals, he succeeded also, in the natural
course of things, in suppressing the popular franchises.
These rights, however, still subsisted, the prince-bishop
being elected by the people&mdash;a fact recorded
by Saint Bernard at the election of Ardutius.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> The
prince even made oath of fidelity to the people.
Occasionally the citizens opposed the prelate’s encroachments,
and refused to be dragged before the
court of Rome.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></p>

<p>Christianity was intended to be a power of liberty;
Rome, by corrupting it, made it a power of despotism;
Calvin, by regenerating it, set it up again and restored
its first work.</p>

<p>But what threatened most the independence and
liberty of Geneva, was not the bishops and counts,
but a power alien to it, that had begun by robbing
the counts of their towns and villages. The house of
Savoy, devoured by an insatiable ambition, strove to
enlarge its dominions with a skill and perseverance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
that were crowned with the most rapid success.
When the princes of Savoy had taken the place of
the counts of Genevois and the dukes of Zœhringen
in the Pays de Vaud, Geneva, which they looked
upon as an <i>enclave</i>, became the constant object of
their desires. They hovered for centuries over the
ancient city, like those Alpine vultures which, spreading
their wings aloft among the clouds, explore the
country beneath with their glance, swoop down upon
the prey, and return day after day until they have
devoured each fragment. Savoy had her eyes fixed
upon Geneva,&mdash;first, through ambition, because the
possession of this important city would round off and
strengthen her territory; and second, through calculation,
because she discovered in this little state certain
principles of right and liberty that alarmed her.
What would become of the absolute power of princes,
obtained at the cost of so many usurpations, if liberal
theories should make their way into European law?
A nest built among the craggy rocks of the Alps may
perhaps contain a brood of inoffensive eaglets; but
as soon as their wings grow, they will soar into the
air, and with their piercing eyes discover the prey and
seize it from afar. The safer course, then, is for some
strong hand to kill them in their nest while young.</p>

<p>The relations between Savoy and Geneva&mdash;one
representing absolutism, the other liberty&mdash;have been
and are still frequently overlooked. They are of
importance, however, to the history of Geneva, and
even of the Reformation. For this reason we are
desirous of sketching them.</p>

<p>The terrible struggle of which we have just spoken
began in the first half of the thirteenth century. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
house of Savoy finding two powers at Geneva and in
Genevois, the bishop and the count, resolved to take
advantage of their dissensions to creep both into the
province and into the city, and to take their place.
It declared first in favour of the bishop against the
count, the more powerful of the two, in order to
despoil him. Peter of Savoy, Canon of Lausanne, became
in 1229, at the age of twenty-six, Provost of the
Canons of Geneva; and having thus an opportunity
of knowing the city, of appreciating the importance
of its situation, and discovering the beauties that lay
around it, he took a liking to it. Being a younger son
of a Count of Savoy, he could easily have become a
bishop; but under his amice, the canon concealed the
arm of a soldier and the genius of a politician. On the
death of his father in 1232, he threw off his cassock,
turned soldier, married Agnes whom the Count of
Faucigny made his heiress at the expense of her elder
sister, and then took to freebooting.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> Somewhat later,
being the uncle of Elinor of Provence, Queen of England,
he was created Earl of Richmond by his nephew
Henry III., and studied the art of government in
London. But the banks of the Thames could not make
him forget those of the Leman. The castle of Geneva
remained, as we have seen above, the private property
of his enemy the Count of Geneva, and this he made
up his mind to seize. ‘A wise man,’ says an old
chronicler, ‘of lofty stature and athletic strength,
proud, daring, terrible as a lion, resembling the most
famous paladins, so brave that he was called the
valiant (<i>preux</i>) Charlemagne’&mdash;possessing the organising
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
genius that founds states and the warlike
disposition that conquers them&mdash;Peter seized the
castle of Geneva in 1250, and held it as a security for
35,000 silver marks which he pretended the count
owed him. He was now somebody in the city. Being
a man of restless activity, enterprising spirit, rare
skill, and indefatigable perseverance, he used this foundation
on which to raise the edifice of his greatness
in the valley of the Leman.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> The people of Geneva,
beginning to grow weary of ecclesiastical authority,
desired to enjoy freely those communal franchises
which the clergy called ‘the worst of institutions.’<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a>
When he became Count of Savoy, Peter, who had
conceived the design of annexing Geneva to his
hereditary states, promised to give the citizens all
they wanted; and the latter, who already (two
centuries and a half before the Reformation) desired
to shake off the temporal yoke of their bishop, put
themselves under his guardianship. But erelong
they grew alarmed, they feared the sword of the
warrior more than the staff of the shepherd, and
were content with their clerical government</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">De peur d’en rencontrer un pire.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In 1267 the second Charlemagne was forced to
declare by a public act that he refused to take
Geneva under his protection.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> Disgusted with this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
failure, weakened by age, and exhausted by his
unceasing activity, Peter retired to his castle at
Chillon, where every day he used to sail on that
beautiful lake, luxuriously enjoying the charms of
nature that lay around; while the harmonious voice
of a minstrel, mingling with the rippling of the
waters, celebrated before him the lofty deeds of the
illustrious paladin. He died in 1268.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></p>

<p>Twenty years later Amadeus V. boldly renewed the
assault in which his uncle had failed. A man full
of ambition and genius, and surnamed ‘the Great,’
he possessed all the qualities of success. The standard
of the prince must float over the walls of that
free city. Amadeus already possessed a mansion in
Geneva, the old palace of the counts of Genevois,
situated in the upper part of the city. He wished to
have more, and the canons gave him the opportunity
which he sought of beginning his conquest. During
a vacancy of the episcopal see, these reverend fathers
were divided, and those who were hostile to Amadeus,
having been threatened by some of his party, took
refuge in alarm in the Ch&acirc;teau de l’Ile. This castle
Amadeus seized, being determined to show them that
neither strong walls nor the two arms of the river
which encircle the island could protect them against
his wrath. This conquest gave him no authority in
the city; but Savoy was able more than once to use
it for its ambitious projects. It was here in 1518,
shortly after the appearance of Luther, that the most
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
intrepid martyr of modern liberty was sacrificed by
the bishop and the duke.</p>

<p>Amadeus could not rest satisfied with his two
castles: in order to be master in Geneva, he did not
disdain to become a servant. As it was unlawful for
bishops, in their quality of churchmen, to shed blood,
there was an officer commissioned in all the ecclesiastical
principalities to inflict the punishment of
death, <i>vice domini</i>, and hence this lieutenant was
called <i>vidomne</i> or <i>vidame</i>. Amadeus claimed this
vidamy as the reward of his services. In vain did
the citizens, uneasy at the thought of so powerful
a vidame, meet in the church of St. Magdalen
(November 1288); in vain did the bishop forbid
Amadeus, ‘in the name of God, of the glorious Virgin
Mary, of St. Peter, St. Paul, and all the saints, to
usurp the office of lieutenant,’<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> the vulture held the
vidamy in his talons and would not let it go. The
citizens jeered at this sovereign prince who turned
himself into a civil officer. ‘A pretty employment
for a prince&mdash;it is a ministry (<i>minist&egrave;re</i>) not a
magistry (<i>magist&egrave;re</i>)&mdash;service not dominion.’ ‘Well,
well,’ replied the Savoyard, ‘I shall know how to
turn the valet into a master.’<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></p>

<p>The princes of Savoy, who had combined with the
bishop against the Count of Geneva to oust the latter,
having succeeded so well in their first campaign,
undertook a second, and joined the citizens against
the bishop in order to supplant him. Amadeus
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
became a liberal. He knew well that you cannot
gain the hearts of a people better than by becoming the
defender of their liberties. He said to the citizens in
1285, ‘We will <i>maintain</i>, <i>guard</i>, and <i>defend</i> your
city and goods, your <i>rights</i> and <i>franchises</i>, and all that
belongs to you.’<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> If Amadeus was willing to <i>defend</i>
the liberties of Geneva, it is a proof that they existed:
his language is that of a conservative and not of an
innovator. The year 1285 did not, as some have
thought, witness the first origin of the franchises of
Geneva but their revival. There was however at
that time an outgrowth of these liberties. The municipal
institutions became more perfect. The citizens,
taking advantage of Amadeus’s support, elected
<i>rectors</i> of the city, voted taxes, and conferred the
freedom of the city upon foreigners. But the ambitious
prince had calculated falsely. By aiding the
citizens to form a corporation strong enough to defend
their ancient liberties, he raised with imprudent hand
a bulwark against which all the plans of his successors
were doomed to fail.</p>

<p>In the fifteenth century the counts of Savoy,
having become dukes and more eagerly desiring the
conquest of Geneva, changed their tactics a third
time. They thought, that as there was a pope at
Rome, the master of the princes and principalities of
the earth, a pontifical bull would be more potent than
their armies and intrigues to bring Geneva under
the power of Savoy.</p>

<p>It was Duke Amadeus VIII. who began this new
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
campaign. Not satisfied with having enlarged
his states with the addition of Genevois, Bugey,
Verceil, and Piedmont, which had been separated
from it for more than a century, he petitioned Pope
Martin V. to confer on him, for the great advantage
of the Church, the secular authority in Geneva.
But the syndics, councillors, and deputies of the
city, became alarmed at the news of this fresh
manœuvre, and knowing that ‘Rome ought not to
<i>lay its paw</i> upon kingdoms,’ determined to resist
the pope himself, if necessary, in the defence of their
liberties, and placing their hands upon the Gospels
they exclaimed: ‘No alienation of the city or of its
territory&mdash;this we swear.’ Amadeus withdrew his
petition; but Pope Martin V., while staying three
months at Geneva, on his return in 1418 from the
Council of Constance, began to sympathise with the
ideas of the dukes. There was something in the
pontiff which told him that liberty did not accord
with the papal rule. He was alarmed at witnessing
the liberties of the city. ‘He feared those general
councils that spoil everything,’ says a manuscript
chronicle in the Turin library; ‘he felt uneasy about
those turbulent folk, imbued with the ideas of the
Swiss, who were always whispering into the ears of
the Genevese the <i>license of popular government</i>.’<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a>
The liberties of the Swiss were dear to the citizens
a century before the Reformation.</p>

<p>The pope resolved to remedy this, but not in the
way the dukes of Savoy intended. These princes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
desired to secure the independence of Geneva in order
to increase their power; while the popes preferred
confiscating it to their own benefit. At the Council
of Constance, from which Martin was then returning,
it had been decreed that episcopal elections should
take place according to the canonical forms, by the
<i>chapter</i>, unless for some <i>reasonable and manifest</i>
cause the pope should think fit to name a person
more useful to the Church.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> The pontiff thought
that the necessity of resisting popular liberty was
a <i>reasonable</i> motive; and accordingly as soon as he
reached Turin, he translated the Bishop of Geneva
to the archiepiscopal see of the Tarentaise, and heedless
of the rights of the canons and citizens, nominated
Jean de Rochetaill&eacute;e, Patriarch <i>in partibus</i>
of Constantinople, Bishop and Prince of Geneva.
Four years later Martin repeated this usurpation.
Henry V. of England, at that time master of Paris,
taking a dislike to Jean de Courte-Cuisse, bishop of
that capital, the pope, of his sovereign authority,
placed Courte-Cuisse on the episcopal throne of
Geneva, and Rochetaill&eacute;e on that of Paris. Thus
were elections wrested by popes from a christian
people and their representatives. This usurpation
was to Geneva, as well as to many other parts of
christendom, an inexhaustible source of evils.</p>

<p>It followed, among other things, that with the
connivance of Rome, the princes of Savoy might
become princes of Geneva. But could they insure
this connivance? From that moment the activity
of the court of Turin was employed in making
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
interest with the popes in order to obtain the grant
of the bishopric of Geneva for one of the princes
or creatures of Savoy. A singular circumstance
favoured this remarkable intrigue. Duke Amadeus
VIII., who had been rejected by the citizens a few
years before, succeeded in an unexpected manner.
In 1434 having abdicated in favour of his eldest son,
he assumed the hermit’s frock at Ripaille on the Lake
of Geneva; and the Council of Basle having nominated
him pope, he took the name of Felix V. and
made use of his pontifical authority to create himself
bishop and prince of Geneva. A pope making himself
a bishop ... strange thing indeed! Here is the
key to the enigma: the pope was a prince of Savoy:
the see was the see of Geneva. Savoy desired to
have Geneva at any price: one might almost say that
Pope Felix thought it an advancement in dignity to
become a Genevan bishop. It is true that Felix
was pope according to the episcopal, not the papal,
system; having been elected by a council, he was
forced to resign in consequence of the desertion of
the majority of European princes. Geneva and
Ripaille consoled him for Rome.</p>

<p>As bishop and prince of Geneva, he respected the
franchises of his new acquisition; but the poor city
was fated somewhat later to serve as food to the offspring
of this bird of prey. In 1451, Amadeus being
dead, Peter of Savoy, a child eight or ten years old,
grandson of the pope, hermit, and bishop, mounted
the episcopal throne of Geneva; in 1460 came John
Louis, another grandson, twelve years of age; and
in 1482 Francis, a third grandson. To the Genevans
the family of the pope seemed inexhaustible. These
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
bishops and their governors were as leeches sucking
Geneva even to the bones and marrow.</p>

<p>Their mother, Anne of Cyprus, had brought with
her to Savoy a number of ‘Cypriote leeches’ as they
were called, and after they had drained the blood
of her husband’s states, she launched them on the
states of her children. One Cypriote prelate,
Thomas de Sur, whom she had appointed governor
to little Bishop Peter, particularly distinguished
himself in the art of robbing citizens of their money
and their liberty. It was Bishop John Louis, the
least wicked of the three brothers, who inflicted the
most terrible blow on Geneva. We shall tell how
that happened; for this dramatic episode is a picture of
manners, carrying us back to Geneva with its bishops
and its princes, and showing us the family of that
Charles III. who was in the sixteenth century the
constant enemy of the liberties and Reformation
of the city.</p>

<p>Duke Louis of Savoy, son of the pope-duke Amadeus,
was good-tempered, inoffensive, weak, timid,
and sometimes choleric; his wife, Anne of Cyprus
or Lusignan, was arrogant, ambitious, greedy, intriguing,
and domineering; the fifth of their sons,
by name Philip-Monsieur, was a passionate, debauched,
and violent young man. Anne, who
had successively provided for three of her sons by
placing them on the episcopal throne of Geneva,
and who had never met with any opposition from
the eldest Amadeus IX., a youth subject to epilepsy,
had come into collision with Philip. The altercations
between them were frequent and sharp, and
she never missed an opportunity of injuring him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
in his father’s affections; so that the duke, who
always yielded to his wife’s wishes, left the young
prince without appanage. Philip Lackland (for
such was the name he went by) angry at finding
himself thus deprived of his rights, returned his
mother hatred for hatred; and instead of that
family affection, which even the poets of heathen
antiquity have often celebrated, an implacable
enmity existed between the mother and the son.
This Philip was destined to fill an important place
in history; he was one day to wear the crown,
be the father of Charles III. (brother-in-law to
Charles V.) and grandfather of Francis I. through
his daughter Louisa of Savoy. But at this time
nothing announced the high destiny which he would
afterwards attain. Constantly surrounded by young
profligates, he passed a merry life, wandering here
and there with his troop of scapegraces, establishing
himself in castles or in farms; and if the inhabitants
objected, striking those who resisted, killing one
and wounding another, so that he lived in continual
quarrels. ‘As my father left me no fortune,’ he
used to say, ‘I take my property wherever I can
find it.’&mdash;‘All Savoy was in discord,’ say the old
annals, ‘filled with murder, assault, and riot.’<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></p>

<p>The companions of the young prince detested the
<i>Cypriote</i> (as they called the duchess) quite as much
as he did; and in their orgies over their brimming
bowls used the most insulting language towards
her. One day they insinuated that ‘if she plundered
her husband and her son it was to enrich her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
minions.’ Philip swore that he would have justice.
Duke Louis was then lying ill of the gout at Thonon,
on the southern shore of the Lake of Geneva.
Lackland went thither with his companions, and entering
the chapel where mass was going on, killed his
mother’s steward, carried off his father’s chancellor,
put him in a boat and took him to Morges, ‘where
he was drowned in the lake.’ Duke Louis was
terrified; but whither could he flee? In his own
states there was no place where he could feel himself
safe; he could see no other refuge but Geneva,
and there he resolved to go.</p>

<p>John Louis, another of his sons, was then bishop,
and he was strong enough to resist Philip. Although
destined from his infancy for the ecclesiastical estate,
he had acquired neither learning nor manners,
‘seeing that it is not the custom of princes to make
their children scholars,’ say the annals. But on the
other hand he was a good swordsman; dressed not
as a churchman but as a soldier, and passed his
time in ‘dicing, hawking, drinking, and wenching.’
Haughty, blunt, hot-headed, he was often magnanimous,
and always forgave those who had rightfully
offended him. ‘As appears,’ says the old chronicle,
‘from the story of the carpenter, who having surprised
him in a room with his wife, cudgelled him
so soundly, that he was left for dead. Nevertheless,
the bishop would not take vengeance, and went so
far as to give the carpenter the clothes he had on
when he was cudgelled.’</p>

<p>John Louis listened favourably to his father’s
proposals. The duke, Anne of Cyprus, and all the
Cypriote officers arrived at Geneva in July 1642,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
and were lodged at the Franciscan convent and
elsewhere; but none could venture outside Geneva
without being exposed to the attacks of the terrible
Lackland.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>

<p>The arrogant duchess became a prey to alarm:
being both greedy and avaricious, she trembled lest
Philip should succeed in laying hands upon her
treasures; and that she might put them beyond his
reach, she despatched them to Cyprus after this
fashion. In the mountains near Geneva the people
used to make very excellent cheeses; of these she
bought a large number, wishing (she said) that her
friends in Cyprus should taste them. She scraped
out the inside, carefully stored her gold in the
hollow, and therewith loaded some mules, which
started for the East. Philip having received information
of this, stopped the caravan near Friburg,
unloaded the mules, and took away the gold. Now
that he held in his hands these striking proofs of the
duchess’s perfidy, he resolved to slake the hatred he
felt towards her: he would go to Geneva, denounce
his mother to his father, obtain from the exasperated
prince the Cypriote’s dismissal, and receive at last
the appanage of which this woman had so long
deprived him.</p>

<p>Philip, aware that the bishop would not let him
enter the city, resolved to get into it by stratagem.
He repaired secretly to Nyon, and thence despatched
to Geneva the more skilful of his confidants. They
told the syndics and the young men of their acquaintance,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
that their master desired to speak to his father
the duke about a matter of great importance. One
of the syndics (the one, no doubt, who had charge of
the watch) seeing nothing but what was very natural
in this, gave instructions to the patrol; and on the
9th of October, Philip presenting himself at the city
gate&mdash;at midnight, according to Savyon, who is
contradicted by other authorities&mdash;entered and proceeded
straight to Rive, his Highness’s lodging, with
a heart full of bitterness and hatred against his cruel
mother. We shall quote literally the ancient annals
which describe the interview in a picturesque manner:&mdash;‘Philip
knocks at the door; thereupon one of the
chamberlains coming up, asks who is there? He
answers: “I am Philip of Savoy, I want to speak to
my father for his profit.” Whereupon the servant
having made a report, the duke said to him: “Open
to him in the name of all the devils, happen what
may,” and immediately the man opened the door.
As soon as he was come in Philip bowed to his
father, saying: “Good day, father!” His father said:
“God give thee bad day and bad year! What devil
brings thee here now?” To which Philip replied
meekly: “It is not the devil, my lord, but God who
brings me here to your profit, for I warn you that
you are robbed and know it not. There is my lady
mother leaves you nothing, so that, if you take not
good heed, she will not only make your children
after your death the poorest princes in christendom,
but yourself also during your life.”’</p>

<p>At these words Philip opened a casket which contained
the gold intended for Cyprus, and ‘showed
him the wherewithal,’ say the annals. But the duke,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
fearing the storm his wife would raise, took her
part. Monsieur then grew angry: ‘You may bear
with it if you like,’ he said to his father, ‘I will not.
I will have justice of these thieves.’ With these
words he drew his sword and looked under his
father’s bed, hoping to find some Cypriotes beneath
it, perhaps the Cypriote woman herself. He found
nothing there. He then searched all the lodging
with his band, and found nobody, for the Cypriotes
had fled and hidden themselves in various houses
in the city. Monsieur did not dare venture further,
‘for the people were against him,’ say the annals, ‘and
for this cause he quitted his father’s lodging and the
town also without doing other harm.’<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>

<p>The duchess gave way to a burst of passion, the
duke felt very indignant, and Bishop John Louis was
angry. The people flocked together, and as they prevented
the Cypriotes from hanging the men who had
opened the gate to Monsieur, the duke chose another
revenge. He represented to the bishop that his son-in-law
Louis XI., with whom he was negotiating
about certain towns in Dauphiny, detested the
Genevans, and coveted their large fairs to which
people resorted from all the country round. He
begged him therefore to place in his hands the
charters which gave Geneva this important privilege.
The bishop threw open his archives to the duke;
when the latter took the documents in question, and
carrying them to Lyons, where Louis XI. happened
to be, gave them to him. The king immediately
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
transferred the fairs first to Bourges and then to Lyons,
forbidding the merchants to pass through Geneva.
This was a source of great distress to all the city.
Was it not to her fairs, whose privileges were of
such old standing, that Geneva owed her greatness?
While Venice was the mart for the trade of the East,
and Cologne for that of the West, Geneva was in a
fair way to become the mart of the central trade.
Now Lyons was to increase at her expense, and the
city would witness no longer in her thoroughfares
that busy, restless crowd of foreigners coming from
Genoa, Florence, Bologna, Lucca, Brittany, Gascony,
Spain, Flanders, the banks of the Rhine, and all
Germany. Thus the catholic or episcopal power,
which in the eleventh century had stripped Geneva
of her territory, stripped her of her wealth in the
fifteenth. It needed the influx of the persecuted
Huguenots and the industrial activity of Protestantism
to recover it from the blow that the Romish
hierarchy had inflicted.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

<p>This poor tormented city enjoyed however a
momentary respite. In the last year of the fifteenth
century, after the scandals of Bishop Francis of
Savoy, and his clergy and monks, a priest, whom we
may in some respects regard as a precursor of the
Reformation, obtained the episcopal chair. This was
Anthony Champion, an austere man who pardoned
nothing either in himself or others. ‘I desire,’ he
said, ‘to sweep the filth out of my diocese.’ He
took some trouble to do so. On the 7th of May,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
1493, five hundred priests convened by him met in
synod in the church of St. Pierre. ‘Men devoted to
God’s service,’ said the bishop with energy, ‘ought
to be distinguished by purity of life; now our priests
are given to every vice, and lead more execrable
lives than their flocks. Some dress in open frocks,
others assume the soldier’s head-piece, others wear
red cloaks or corslets, frequent fairs, haunt taverns
and houses of ill fame, behave like mountebanks
or players, take false oaths, lend upon pawn, and
unworthily vend indulgences to perjurers and homicides.’
Thus spoke Champion, but he died eighteen
months after the synod, and the priestly corruption
increased.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></p>

<p>In proportion as Geneva grew weaker, Savoy grew
stronger. The duke, by circumstances which must
have appeared to him providential, had lately seen
several provinces settled on different branches of his
house, reunited successively to his own states, and
had thus become one of the most powerful princes
of Europe. La Bresse, Bugey, the Genevois, Gex,
and Vaud, replaced under his sceptre, surrounded and
blockaded Geneva on all sides. The poor little city
was quite lost in the midst of these wide provinces,
bristling with castles; and its territory was so small
that, as they said, there were more Savoyards than
Genevans who heard the bells of St. Pierre. The
states of Savoy enfolded Geneva as in a net, and a
bold stroke of the powerful duke would, it was
thought, be sufficient to crush it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span></p>

<p>The dukes were not only around Geneva, they
were within it. By means of their intrigues with
the bishops, who were their fathers, sons, brothers,
cousins, or subjects, they had crept into the city,
and increased their influence either by flattery and
bribes, or by threats and terror. The vulture had
plumed the weak bird, and imagined that to devour
him would now be an easy task. The duke by
means of some sleight-of-hand trick, in which the
prelate would be his accomplice, might in the
twinkling of an eye entirely change his position&mdash;rise
from the hospitable chair which My Lords of
Geneva so courteously offered him, and seat himself
proudly on a throne. How was the feeble city,
so hunted down, gagged and fettered by its two
oppressors, able to resist and achieve its glorious
liberties? We shall see.</p>

<p>New times were beginning in Europe, God was
touching society with his powerful hand; I say
‘society’ and not the State. Society is above the
State; it always preserves its right of priority, and
in great epochs makes its initiative felt. It is not
the State that acts upon society: the movements of
the latter produce the transformations of the State,
just as it is the atmosphere which directs the course
of a ship, and not the ship which fixes the direction
of the wind. But if society is above the State, God
is above both. At the beginning of the sixteenth
century God was breathing upon the human race,
and this divine breath worked strange revivals in
religious belief, political opinions, civilisation, letters,
science, morals, and industry. A great reformation
was on the eve of taking place.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span></p>

<p>There are also transformations in the order of
nature; but their march is regulated by the creative
power in an unchangeable manner. The succession
of seasons is always the same. The monsoons, which
periodically blow over the Indian seas, continue
for six months in one direction, and for the other
six months in a contrary direction. In mankind,
on the contrary, the wind sometimes comes for
centuries from the same quarter. At the period
we are describing the wind changed after blowing for
nearly a thousand years in the same direction; God
impressed on it a new, vivifying, and renovating
course. There are winds, we know, which, instead
of urging the ship gently forward, tear the sails,
break the masts, and cast the vessel on the rocks,
where it goes to pieces. A school, whose seat is at
Rome, pretends that such was the nature of the
movement worked out in the sixteenth century.
But whoever examines the question impartially, confesses
that the wind of the Reformation has wafted
humanity towards the happy countries of light and
liberty, of faith and morality.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the sixteenth century there
was a living force in Geneva. The ostentatious
mitre of the bishop, the cruel sword of the duke
appeared to command there; and yet a new birth
was forming within its bosom. The renovating
principle was but a puny, shapeless germ, concealed
in the heroic souls of a few obscure citizens; but
its future developments were not doubtful. There
was no power in Christendom able to stem the
outbreak of the human mind, awakening at the
mighty voice of the eternal Ruler. What was to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
be feared was not that the progress of civilisation
and liberty, guided by the Divine word, would fail to
attain its end; but that on the contrary, by abandoning
the supreme rule, the end would be overshot.</p>

<p>Let us enter upon the history of the preparations
for Reform, and contemplate the vigorous struggles
that are about to begin at the foot of the Alps
between despotism and liberty, ultramontanism and
the Gospel.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br />

<span class="small">A BISHOP SENT BY THE POPE TO ROB GENEVA OF ITS
INDEPENDENCE.<br />

(APRIL TO OCTOBER 1513.)</span></h2>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">On</span> the 13th of April, 1513, there was great excitement
in Geneva. Men were dragging cannon
through the streets, and placing them on the walls.
The gates were shut and sentries posted everywhere.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a>
Charles de Seyssel, bishop and prince of Geneva, had
just died on his return from a pilgrimage. He was
a man of a mild and frank disposition, ‘a right good
person,’ says the chronicler, ‘and for a wonder a
great champion of both ecclesiastical and secular
liberty.’ Duke Charles of Savoy, who was less attached
to liberty than this good prelate, had recently had
several sharp altercations with him. ‘It was I who
made you bishop,’ haughtily said the angry duke,
‘but I will unmake you, and you shall be the poorest
priest in the diocese.’<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> The bishop’s crime was
having wished to protect the liberties of the city
against Charles’s usurpations. The prince kept his
word, and, if we may believe the old annals, got rid
of him by poison.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span></p>

<p>When the news of this tragical and unexpected
death reached Geneva, the citizens were alarmed:
they argued that no doubt the secret intention of
the duke was to place a member of his family on
the episcopal throne, in order thus to obtain the
seigniory of the city. The excited citizens gathered
in groups in the streets, and impassioned orators,
among whom was Philibert Berthelier, addressed the
people. The house from which this great citizen
sprang appears to have been of high position, as
early as the twelfth century; but he was one of those
noble natures who court glory by placing themselves
at the service of the weak. No man seemed better
fitted to save Geneva. Just, generous, proud,
decided, he was above all firm, true, and attached to
what was right. His glorious ambition was not
revolutionary: he wished to uphold the right and
not to combat it. The end he set before himself
was not, properly speaking, the emancipation of his
country, but the restoration of its franchises and
liberties. He affected no great airs, used no big
words, was fond of pleasure and the noisy talk of his
companions; but there were always observable in
him a seriousness of thought, great energy, a strong
will, and above all a supreme contempt of life.
Enamoured of the ancient liberties of his city, he was
always prepared to sacrifice himself for them.</p>

<p>‘The duke,’ said Berthelier and his friends in their
animated meetings, ‘received immediate news of the
death of the bishop, as did the pope also. The messengers
are galloping with the news, each wants to have
his share of the skin of the dead beast.’ The patriots
argued that if the pope had long since laid hands on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
the Church, the Duke of Savoy now desired to lay his
upon the State. Geneva would not be the first place
that had witnessed such usurpations. Other cities of
Burgundy, Grenoble, Gap, Valence, Die, and Lyons,
had fallen one after the other beneath a foreign power.
‘We ourselves,’ said the citizens in the energetic and
somewhat homely language of the day, ‘have had
our wings cut so short already, that we can hardly
spit from our walls without bespattering the duke.
Having begun his conquest, he now wishes to complete
it. He has put his <i>snout</i> into the city and is
trying to get in all his body. Let us resist him.
Is there a people whose franchises are older than
ours? We have always been free, and there is no
memory of man to the contrary.’<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> The citizens were
resolved accordingly to close their gates against the
influence of Savoy, and to elect a bishop themselves.
They called to mind that when Ardutius, descending
from his eyrie in the rocks of the Mole, was named
bishop of Geneva, it was by the accord of clergy and
people.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> ‘Come, you canons,’ said they, ‘choose
us a bishop that will not let the duke put his nose
into his soup.’<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> This rather vulgar expression meant
simply this: ‘Elect a bishop who will defend our
liberties.’ They had not far to seek.</p>

<p>There was among the canons of Geneva one Aim&eacute;
de Gingins, abbot of Bonmont and dean of the
chapter, a man of noble house, and well connected
in the Swiss cantons. His father Jacques, seignior
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
of Gingins, Divonne, and other places, had been councillor,
chamberlain, and high steward to the Duke
of Savoy, and even ambassador from him to Pope
Paul II. Aim&eacute;, who had been appointed canon of
St. Pierre’s in Geneva when very young, was forty-eight
years old at this time. He was ‘the best
boon-companion in the world, keeping open house
and feasting joyously the friends of pleasure,’ fond
of hearing his companions laugh and sing, and of
rather free manners, after the custom of the Church;
but he excused himself with a smile, saying, without
blush or shame: ‘It is a <i>slippery</i> sin.’ M. de
Bonmont was the most respected of the priests in
Geneva, for while his colleagues were devoted heart
and soul to the house of Savoy, the dean stood by
Geneva, and was no stranger to the aspirations
which led so many generous minds to turn towards
the ancient liberties. The people named him bishop
by acclamation, and the chapter confirmed their
choice; and forthwith the citizens made every effort
to uphold the election. They prayed the Swiss
cantons to support it before the pope, and sent to
Rome ‘by post both letters and agents.’<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></p>

<p>If this election by the chapter had been sustained,
it is probable that M. de Gingins would have
lived on good terms with the council and citizens,
and that harmony would have been preserved.
But the appointment of bishops, which had in olden
times belonged to the clergy and the people, had
passed almost everywhere to the prince and the
pope. The election of a superior by the subordinates
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
had given way to the nomination of an
inferior by a superior. This was a misfortune:
nothing secures a good election like the first of these
two systems, for the interest and honour of the
governed is always to have good governors. On
the other hand, princes or popes generally choose
strangers or favourites, who win neither the affection
nor esteem of their flocks or of the inferior clergy.
The last episcopal elections at Geneva, by separating
the episcopacy from the people and the clergy, deprived
the Church of the strength it so much needed,
and facilitated the Reformation.</p>

<p>Duke Charles understood the importance of the
crisis. This prince who filled for half a century the
throne of Savoy and Piedmont, was all his life the
implacable enemy of Geneva. Weak but irritable,
impatient of all opposition yet undecided, proud, awkward,
wilful, fond of pomp but without grandeur, stiff
but wanting firmness, not daring to face the strong,
but always ready to be avenged on the weak, he had
but one passion&mdash;one mania rather: to possess
Geneva. For that he needed a docile instrument to
lend a hand to his ambitious designs&mdash;a bishop with
whom he could do what he pleased. Accordingly he
looked around him for some one to oppose to the
people’s candidate, and he soon hit upon the man.
In every party of pleasure at court there was sure
to be found a little man, weak, slender, ill-made,
awkward, vile in body but still more so in mind,
without regard for his honour, inclined rather to
do evil than good, and suffering under a disease
the consequence of his debauchery. This wretch
was John, son of a wench of Angers (<i>communis</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
<i>generis</i>, says Bonivard) whose house was open to
everybody, priests and laymen alike; sparely liberal
with her money (for she had not the means) ‘she
was over-free with her venal affections.’ Francis
of Savoy, the third of the pope-duke’s grandsons, who
had occupied in turn the episcopal throne of Geneva,
and who was also archbishop of Aux and bishop
of Angers, used to ‘junket with her like the rest.’
This woman was about to become a mother, ‘but she
knew not,’ says the chronicler, ‘whom to select as
the father; the bishop being the richest of all her
lovers, she fathered the child upon him, and it was
reared at the expense of the putative parent.’ The
Bishop of Angers not caring to have this child in his
diocese, sent it to his old episcopal city, where there
were people devoted to him.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> The poor little sickly
child was accordingly brought to Geneva, and there he
lived meanly until being called to the court of Turin,
he had a certain retinue assigned him, three horses, a
servant, a chaplain, and the title of <i>bastard of Savoy</i>.
He then began to hold up his head, and became the
greediest, the most intriguing, the most irregular priest
of his day. ‘That’s the man to be bishop of Geneva,’
thought the duke: ‘he is so much in my debt, he can
refuse me nothing.’ There was no bargain the bastard
would not snap at, if he could gain either money or
position: to give up Geneva to the duke was an easy
matter to him. Charles sent for him. ‘Cousin,’ said
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
he, ‘I will raise you to a bishopric, if in return you
will make over the temporality to me.’ The bastard
promised everything: it was an unexpected means of
paying his debt to the duke, which the latter talked
about pretty loudly. ‘He has sold us not in the ear
but in the blade,’ said Bonivard, ‘for he has made
a present of us before we belonged to him.’<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></p>

<p>The duke without loss of time despatched his cousin
to Rome, under the pretext of bearing his congratulations
to Leo X. who had just succeeded Julius II.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a>
John the Bastard and his companions travelled so fast
that they arrived before the Swiss. At the same time
the court of Turin omitted nothing to secure the
possession of a city so long coveted. First, they
began to canvass all the cardinals they could get at.
On the 24th February the Cardinal of St. Vital, and
on the 1st March the Cardinal of Flisco promised
their services to procure the bishopric of Geneva for
John of Savoy.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> On the 20th of April the Queen of
Naples wrote to the duke, that she had recommended
John to her nephew, the Cardinal of Aragon.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> This
was not enough. An unforeseen circumstance favoured
the designs of Savoy.</p>

<p>The illustrious Leo X. who had just been raised
to the papal throne, had formed the design of allying
his family to one of the oldest houses in Europe.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
With this intent he cast his eyes on the Princess
Philiberta of Savoy; a pure simple-hearted young
girl, of an elevated mind, a friend to the poor, younger
sister to the duke and Louisa of Savoy, aunt of Francis
I. and Margaret of Valois. Leo X. determined
to ask her hand for his brother Julian the Magnificent,
lieutenant-general of the armies of the Church.
Up to this time Julian had not lived a very edifying
life; he was deeply enamoured of a widow of Urbino,
who had borne him a son.</p>

<p>To tempt the duke to this marriage, which was
very flattering to the <i>parvenus</i> of Florence, the pope
made ‘many promises,’ say the Italian documents.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a>
He even sent an envoy to the court of Turin to tell
Charles that he might ‘expect from him all that
the best of sons may expect from the tenderest of
fathers.’<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></p>

<p>The affair could only be decided at Rome, and
Leo X. took much trouble about it. He received the
bastard of Savoy with the greatest honour, and this
disagreeable person had the chief place at banquet,
theatre, and concert. Leo took pleasure in talking
with him, and made him describe Philiberta’s charms.
As for making him bishop of Geneva, that did not
cause the least difficulty. The pope cared nothing
for Dean de Bonmont, the chapter, or the Genevans.
‘Let the duke give us his sister, and we will give
you Geneva,’ said he to the graceless candidate. ‘You
will then make over the temporal power to the duke.... The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
court of Rome will not oppose it; on the
contrary, it will support you.’ Everything was settled
between the pope, the duke, and the bastard. ‘John
of Savoy,’ says a manuscript, ‘swore to hand over the
temporal jurisdiction of the city to the duke, and the
pope swore he would force the city to consent under
pain of incurring the thunders of the Vatican.’<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></p>

<p>This business was hardly finished when the Swiss
envoys arrived, empowered to procure the confirmation
of Dean de Bonmont in his office of bishop. Simple
and upright but far less skilful than the Romans and
the Piedmontese, they appeared before the pope.
Alas! these Alpine shepherds had no princess to offer
to the Medici. ‘Nescio vos,’ said Leo X. ‘Begone, I
know you not.’ He had his reasons for this rebuff;
he had already nominated the bastard of Savoy bishop
of Geneva.</p>

<p>It was impossible to do a greater injury to any
church. For an authority, and especially an elective
authority, to be legitimate, it ought to be in the
hands of the best and most intelligent, and he who
exercises it, while administering with zeal, should
not infringe the liberties of those he governs. But
these are ideas that never occurred to the worthless
man, appointed by the pope chief pastor of
Geneva. He immediately however found flatterers.
They wrote to him (and the letters are in the Archives
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
of Geneva) that his election had been made <i>by the
flock</i> ... ‘not by mortal favour, but by God’s aid
alone.’ It was however by the favour of the Queen of
Naples, of Charles III., and by several other very
mortal favours, that he had been nominated. He
was exhorted to govern his church with integrity,
justice, and diligence, as became his <i>singular gravity
and virtue</i>.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> The bastard did not make much account
of these exhortations; his reign was a miserable farce,
a long scandal. Leo X. was not a lucky man. By the
traffic in indulgences he provoked the Reformation of
Wittemberg, and by the election of the bastard he paved
the way for the Reformation of Geneva. These are
two false steps for which Rome has paid dearly.</p>

<p>The news of this election filled the hearts of the
Genevan patriots with sorrow and indignation. They
assembled in the public places, murmuring and ‘complaining
to one another,’ and the voices of Berthelier
and Hugues were heard above all the rest. They
declared they did not want the bastard, that they
already had a bishop, honoured by Geneva and all the
league, and who had every right to the see because
he was dean of the chapter. They insinuated that if
Leo X. presumed to substitute this intrusive Savoyard
for their legitimate bishop, it was because the house
of Savoy wished to lay hands upon Geneva. They
were especially exasperated at the well-known character
of the Romish candidate. ‘A fine election
indeed his Holiness has honoured us with!’ said they.
‘For our bishop he gives us a disreputable clerk; for
our guide in the paths of virtue, a dissipated bastard;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
for the preserver of our ancient and venerable liberties,
a scoundrel ready to sell them.’ ... Nor did
they stop at murmurs; Berthelier and his friends
remarked that as the storm came from the South,
they ought to seek a shelter in the North; and
though Savoy raised her foot against Geneva to crush
it, Switzerland stretched out her hand to save it.
‘Let us be masters at home,’ they said, ‘and shut
the gates against the pope’s candidate.’</p>

<p>All did not think alike: timid men, servile priests,
and interested friends of Savoy trembled as they
heard this bold language. They thought, that if they
rejected the bishop sent from Rome, the pope would
launch his thunders and the duke his soldiers against
Geneva. The canons of the cathedral and the richest
merchants held lands in the states of Charles, so that
(says a manuscript) the prince could at pleasure
‘starve them to death.’ These influential men carried
the majority with them, and it was resolved to accept
the bishop nominated at Rome. When the leaders of
the independent party found themselves beaten, they
determined to carry out forthwith the plan they had
formed. On the 4th of July, 1513, Philibert Berthelier,
Besan&ccedil;on Hugues, Jean Taccon, Jean Baud,
N. Tissot, and H. Pollier petitioned Friburg for
the right of citizenship <i>in order to secure their lives
and goods</i>; and it was granted. This energetic step
might prove their ruin; the duke might find the
means of teaching them a bloody lesson. That mattered
not: a great step had been taken; the bark of
Geneva was made fast to the ship that would tow
them into the waters of liberty. As early as 1507
three patriots, Pierre L&eacute;vrier, Pierre Taccon, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
D. Fonte, had allied themselves to Switzerland. Now
they were nine, drawn up on the side of independence,
a small number truly, and yet the victory was
destined to remain with them. History has often
shown that there is another majority besides the
majority of numbers.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></p>

<p>While this little band of patriots was on its way to
embrace the altar of liberty in Switzerland, the ducal
and clerical party was making ready to prostrate itself
slavishly before the Savoyard prince. The more the
patriots had opposed him, the more the episcopalians
laboured to give him a splendid reception. On the
31st of August, 1513, the new prince-bishop entered
the city under a magnificent canopy; the streets and
galleries were hung with garlands and tapestry, the
trades walked magnificently costumed to the sound of
fife and drum, and theatres were improvised for the representation
of miracles, dramas, and farces. It was to
no purpose that a few citizens in bad humour shrugged
their shoulders and said: ‘He is truly as foul in body
as in mind.’ The servile worshipped him, some even
excusing themselves humbly for having appeared to
oppose him. They represented that such opposition
was not to his lordship’s person, but simply because
they desired to maintain their right of election. John
of Savoy, who had said to himself, ‘I will not spur
the horse before I am firm in the saddle,’ answered
only by a smile of his livid lips: both people and
bishop were acting a part. When he arrived in front
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
of the cathedral, the new prelate met the canons,
dressed in their robes of silk and damask, with hoods
and crosses, each according to his rank. They had felt
rather annoyed in seeing the man of their choice, the
abbot of Bonmont, unceremoniously set aside by the
pope; but the honour of having a prince of the ducal
family for their bishop was some compensation. These
reverend gentlemen, almost all of them partisans of
Savoy, received the bastard with great honour, bowing
humbly before him. The bishop then entered
the church, and standing in front of the altar, with
an open missal before him, as was usual, made solemn
oath to the syndics, in presence of the people,
to maintain the liberties and customs of Geneva.
Certain good souls took him at his word and appeared
quite reassured; but the more intelligent
wore a look of incredulity, and placed but little
trust in his protestations. The bishop having been
recognised and proclaimed sovereign, quitted the
church and entered the episcopal palace to recruit
himself after such unusual fatigue. There he took
his seat in the midst of a little circle of courtiers,
and raising his head, said to them: ‘Well, gentlemen,
we have next to <i>savoyardise</i> Geneva. The city has
been quite long enough separated from Savoy only by
a ditch, without crossing it. I am commissioned to
make her take the leap.’ These were almost the first
words the bastard uttered after having sworn before
God to maintain the independence of the city.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></p>

<p>The bishop, naturally crafty and surrounded by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
counsellors more crafty still, was eager to know who
were the most influential men of the party opposed
to him, being resolved to confer on them some striking
mark of his favour. First he met with one name
which was in every mouth&mdash;it was that of Philibert
Berthelier. The bishop saw this citizen mingling
with the people, simple, cheerful, and overflowing
with cordiality, taking part in all the merry-makings
of the young folks of Geneva, winning them by the
animated charm of his manners, and by the important
services he was always ready to do them.
‘Good!’ thought John of Savoy, ‘here is a man I
must have. If I gain him, I shall have nothing to fear
for my power in Geneva.’ He resolved to give him one
of the most honourable charges at his disposal. Some
persons endeavoured to dissuade the bishop: they told
him that under a trifling exterior Berthelier concealed
a rebellious, energetic, and unyielding mind. ‘Fear
nothing,’ answered John, ‘he sings gaily and drinks
with the young men of the town.’ It was true that
Berthelier amused himself with the <i>Enfans de Gen&egrave;ve</i>,<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a>
but it was to kindle them at his fire. He possessed
the two qualities necessary for great things: a popular
spirit, and an heroic character; practical sense
to act upon men, and an elevated mind to conceive
great ideas.</p>

<p>The bishop, to whom all noble thoughts were
unknown, appeared quite enchanted with the great
citizen; being always ready to sell himself, he doubted
not that the proud Genevan was to be bought. The
Castle of Peney, situated two leagues from the city,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
and built in the thirteenth century by a bishop of
Geneva, happened at that time to be without a commandant:
‘You shall have the governorship of
Peney,’ said the prelate to Berthelier. The latter
was astonished, for it was, as we have said, one of
the most important posts in the State. ‘I understand
it all,’ said he, ‘Peney is the apple which
the serpent gave to Eve.’ ‘Or rather,’ added Bonivard,
‘the apple which the goddess of Discord threw
down at the marriage of Peleus.’ Berthelier refused;
but the bastard still persisted, making fine
promises for the future of the city. At last he
accepted the charge, but with the firm intention of
resigning it as soon as his principles required it.
The bishop could not even dream of a resignation:
such an act would be sheer madness in his eyes; so
believing that he had caught Berthelier, he thought
that Geneva could not now escape him. This was
not all; the bishop elect, M. de Gingins, whose place
the bastard had taken, possessed great influence in
the city. John gave him a large pension. Believing
he had thus disposed of his two principal adversaries,
he used to joke about it with his courtiers. ‘It is a
bone in their mouths,’ said they, laughing and clapping
their hands, ‘which will prevent their barking.’<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a></p>

<p>The people had next to be won over. ‘Two features
characterise the Genevans,’ said the partisans
of Savoy to the bishop, ‘the love of liberty and the
love of pleasure.’ Hence the counsellors of the
Savoyard prince concluded, that it would be necessary
to manœuvre so as to make one of these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
propensities destroy the other. The cue was accordingly
given. Parties, balls, banquets, and entertainments
were held at the palace and in all the
houses of the Savoyard party. There was one
obstacle however. The bastard was naturally melancholy
and peevish, and his disease by no means
tended to soften this morose disposition. But John
did violence to himself, and determined to keep open
house. ‘Nothing was seen at the palace but junketing,
dicing, dancing, and feasting.’ The prelate leaving
his apartments, would appear at these joyous
entertainments, with his wan and gloomy face, and
strive to smile. Go where you would, you heard
the sound of music and the tinkling of glasses.
The youth of Geneva was enchanted; but the good
citizens felt alarmed. ‘The bishop, the churchmen,
and the Savoyards,’ they said, ‘effeminate and
<i>cowardise</i> our young men by toothsome meats,
gambling, dancing, and other immoderate delights.’
Nor did they rest satisfied with complaining; they
took the young citizens aside, and represented to
them that if the bishop and his party were lavish of
their amusements, it was only to make them forget
their love for the common weal. ‘They are doing
as Circe did with the companions of Ulysses,’ said a
man of wit, ‘and their enchanted draughts have no
other object than to change men into swine.’ But
the bastard, the canons, and the Savoyard nobles continued
to put wine upon their tables and to invite the
most charming damsels to their balls. The youths
could not resist; they left the old men to their
dotage; in their intoxication they indulged with all
the impetuosity of their age in bewitching dances,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
captivating music, and degrading disorders. Some
of the young lords, as they danced or drank, whispered
in their ears: ‘Fancy what it would be if the
duke established his court with its magnificent f&ecirc;tes
at Geneva.’ And these thoughtless youths forgot
the liberties and the mission of their country.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></p>

<p>Among the young men whom the courtiers of Savoy
were leading into vice, was the son of the bishop’s procurator-fiscal.
One of the ablest devices of the dukes
who desired to annex Geneva to their states, had been
to induce a certain number of their subjects to settle
in the city. These Savoyards, being generally rich men
and of good family, were joyfully welcomed and often
invested with some important office, but they always
remained devoted to the ducal interests. Of this
number were F. Cartelier of La Bresse, M. Guillet,
seignior of Montbard, and Pierre Navis of Rumilly
in Genevois; all these played an important part in
the crisis we are about to describe. Navis, admitted
citizen in 1486, elected councillor in 1497, was a
proud and able man, a good lawyer, thoroughly
devoted to the duke, and who thought he was serving
him faithfully by the unjust charges he brought against
the patriots. Andrew, the youngest of his sons, was a
waggish, frolicsome, noisy boy who, if sometimes showing
a certain respect to his father, was often obstinate
and disobedient. When he passed from boyhood to
youth, his passions gained more warmth, his imagination
more fire: family ties sufficed him no longer, and
he felt within him a certain longing which urged him
towards something unknown. The knowledge of God
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
would have satisfied the wants of his ardent soul; but he
could find it nowhere. It was at this period, he being
twenty-three years old, that John of Savoy arrived in
Geneva, and his courtiers began to lay their toils.
The birth of Andrew Navis marked him out for their
devices, and it was his fate to be one of their earliest
victims. He rushed into every kind of enjoyment with
all the impetuosity of youth, and pleasure held the
chief place in his heart. Rapidly did he descend the
steps of the moral scale: he soon wallowed in debauchery,
and shrank not from the most shameful acts.
Sometimes his conscience awoke and respect for his
father gained the upper hand; but some artful seduction
soon drew him back again into vice. He spent in
disorderly living his own money and that of his family.
‘When I want money,’ he said, ‘I write in my father’s
office; when I have it, I spend it with my friends or
in roaming about.’ He was soon reduced to shifts to
find the means of keeping up his libertinism. One day
his father sent him on horseback to Chambery, where
he had some business to transact. Andrew fell to
gambling on the road, lost his money, and sold his
horse to have the chance of winning it back. He
did worse even than this: on two several occasions,
when he was short of money, he stole horses and sold
them. He was not however the only profligate in
Geneva: the bishop and his courtiers were training up
others; the priests and monks whom John found at
Geneva, also gave cause for scandal. It was these
immoralities that induced the citizens to make early
and earnest complaints to the bishop.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.<br />

<span class="small">OPPOSITION TO THE DESIGNS OF THE DUKE, THE POPE, AND
THE BISHOP.<br />

(1513-1515.)</span></h2>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> opposition to the bishop was shown in various
ways and came from different quarters. The
magistrates, the young and new defenders of independence,
and lastly (what was by no means expected)
the cardinals themselves thwarted the plan formed to
deprive Geneva of its independence. Opinion, ‘the
queen of the world,’ as it has been called, overlooked
worldliness in priests but not libertinism. Debauchery
had entered into the manners of the papacy. The
Church of the middle ages, an external and formal institution,
dispensed with morality in its ministers and
members. Dante and Michael Angelo place both
priests and popes in hell, whether libertines or poisoners.
The crimes of the priest (according to Rome)
do not taint the divine character with which he is
invested. A man may be a holy father&mdash;nay, God
upon earth&mdash;and yet be a brigand. At the time
when the Reformation began there were certain articles
of faith imposed in the Romish church, certain
hierarchies, ceremonies, and practices; but of morality
there was none; on the contrary, all this framework
naturally tended to encourage Christians to do without
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
it. Religion (I reserve the exceptions) was not the
man: it was a corpse arrayed in magnificent garments,
and underneath all eaten with worms. The Reformation
restored life to the Church. If salvation is not
to be found in adherence to the pope and cardinals,
but in an inward, living, personal communion with
God, a renewal of the heart is obligatory. It was
within the sphere of morality that the first reforming
tendencies were shown at Geneva.</p>

<p>In the month of October 1513 the complaints in
the council were very loud: ‘Who ought to set the
people an example of morality, if not the priests?’
said many noble citizens; ‘but our canons and
our priests are gluttons and drunkards, they keep
women unlawfully, and have bastard children as all
the world knows.’<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> Adjoining the Grey Friars’ convent
at Rive stood a house that was in very bad
repute. One day a worthless fellow, named Morier,
went and searched the convent for a woman who
lived in this house, whom these reverend monks had
carried off. The youth of the city followed him,
found the poor wretch hidden in a cell, and carried
her away with great uproar. The monks attracted
by the noise appeared at their doors or in the corridors
but did not venture to detain her. Morier’s
comrades escorted her back in triumph, launching
their jokes upon the friars.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> The Augustines of our
Lady of Grace were no better than the Franciscans
of Rive, and the monks of St. Victor did no honour to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
their chief. All round their convents were a number
of low houses in which lived the men and women who
profited by their debauchery.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></p>

<p>The evil was still greater among the Dominicans of
Plainpalais: the syndics and council were forced to
banish two of them, Brother Marchepalu and Brother
Nicolin, for indulging in abominable practices in this
monastery.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> The monks even offered accommodation
for the debaucheries of the town; they threw open
for an entrance-fee the extensive gardens of their
monastery, which lay between the Rhone and the
Arve, and whose deep shades served to conceal improper
meetings and midnight orgies.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> Nobody in
Geneva had so bad a reputation as these monks: they
were renowned for their vices. In the way of avarice,
impurity, and crime, there was nothing of which they
were not thought capable. ‘What an obstinate
devil would fear to do,’ said some one, ‘a reprobate
and disobedient monk will do without hesitation.’<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a></p>

<p>What could be expected of a clergy at whose head
were popes like John XXIII., Alexander VI., or
Innocent VIII., who having sixteen illegitimate children
when he assumed the tiara, was loudly proclaimed
‘the father of the Roman people?’<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> The separation
between religion and morality was complete; every
attempt at reform, made for centuries by pious ecclesiastics,
had failed: there seemed to be nothing that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
could cure this inveterate, epidemic, and frightful
disease:&mdash;nothing save God and his Word.</p>

<p>The magistrates of Geneva resolved however to
attempt some reforms, and at least to protest against
insupportable abominations. On Tuesday, 10th October,
the syndics appeared in a body before the
episcopal council, and made their complaints of the
conduct of the priests.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> But what could be expected
from the council of a prelate who bore in his own
person, visibly to all, the shameful traces of his infamous
debaucheries? They hushed up complaints that
compromised the honour of the clergy, the ambition
of the duke, and the mitre of the bishop. However
the blow was struck, the moral effect remained.
One thought sank from that hour deep into the
hearts of upright men: they saw that something new
was wanted to save religion, morality, and liberty.
Some even said that as reforms from below were
impossible, there needed a reform from heaven.</p>

<p>It was at this moment when the breeze was blowing
towards independence, and when the liberal party saw
its defenders multiplying, that there came to Geneva
a brilliant young man, sparkling with wit, and full of
Livy, Cicero, and Virgil. The priests received him
heartily on account of his connection with several prelates,
and the liberals did the same on account of
his good-humour; he soon became a favourite with
everybody and the hero of the moment. He had so
much imagination: he knew so well how to amuse
his company! This young man was not a superficial
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
thinker: in our opinion he is one of the best French
writers of the beginning of the 16th century, but he
is also one of the least known. Francis Bonivard&mdash;such
was the name of this agreeable scholar&mdash;had,
in the main, little faith and little morality;
but he was to play in Geneva by his liberalism, his
information, and his cutting satires, a part not very
unlike that played by Erasmus in the great Reformation.
As you left the city by the Porte St. Antoine,
you came almost immediately to a round church,
and by its side a monastery inhabited by some
monks of Clugny,<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> whose morals, as we have seen,
were not very exemplary. This was the priory of
St. Victor, and within its walls were held many of
the conversations and conferences that prepared the
way for the Reformation. St. Victor was a small
state with a small territory, and its prior was a
sovereign prince. On the 7th of December, 1514,
the prior, John Aim&eacute; Bonivard, was on his death-bed,
and by his side sat his nephew Francis, then one-and-twenty.
He was born at Seyssel;<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> his father
had occupied a certain rank at the court of Duke
Philibert of Savoy, and his mother was of the noble
family of Menthon. Francis belonged to that population
of nobles and churchmen whom the dukes of Savoy
had transplanted to Geneva to corrupt the citizens.
He was educated at Turin, where he had become the
ringleader of the wild set at the university; and ever
carrying with him his jovial humour, he seemed made
to be an excellent bait to entice the youth of the city
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
into the nets of Savoy. But it was far otherwise, he
chose the path of liberty.</p>

<p>For the moment he thought only of his uncle whose
end seemed to have arrived. He did not turn from
him his anxious look, for the old prior was seriously
agitated on his dying bed. Formerly, in a moment of
irritation, he had ordered four large culverins to be
cast at the expense of the Church in order to besiege
the seignior of Viry, one of his neighbours, in his
castle at the foot of Mount Saleve. Old Bonivard had
committed many other sins, but he troubled himself
little about them, compared with this. These large
guns, purchased out of the ecclesiastical revenues,
with a view to kill men and batter down the castle
of an old friend, gave him a fearful pang.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> In his
anguish he turned towards his nephew. He had
found an expedient, a meritorious work which seemed
calculated to bring back peace to his agitated conscience.
‘Francis,’ he said to his nephew, ‘listen to
me; you know those pieces of cannon ... they
ought to be employed in God’s service. I desire that
immediately after my death they may be cast into
bells for the church.’ Francis gave his promise, and
the prior expired satisfied, leaving to his nephew the
principality, the convent, and the culverins.</p>

<p>A close sympathy soon united Berthelier and
Bonivard. The former had more energy, the latter
more grace; but they both belonged to the new generation;
they became brothers in arms, and promised to
wage a merciless war against superstition and arbitrary
power. They gave each other mutual marks of their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
affection, Bonivard standing godfather for one of
Berthelier’s sons. Berthelier, having paid his friend
a visit of condolence on the very day of his uncle’s
death, heard from his lips the story of the culverins.
‘What!’ said he, ‘cast cannons to make into bells!
We will give you as much metal as you require to
make a peal that shall ring loud enough to stun you;
but the culverins ought to remain culverins.’ Bonivard
represented that, according to his uncle’s orders,
the cannon were to be employed in the service of the
Church. ‘The Church will be doubly served,’ retorted
Berthelier; ‘there will be bells at St. Victor,
which is the church, and artillery in the city, which
is the church land.’ He laid the matter before the
council, who voted all that Berthelier required.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a></p>

<p>But the Duke of Savoy had no sooner heard of this
than he claimed the guns from the monastery. The
Council of Fifty was convened to discuss the affair, and
Berthelier did not stand alone in supporting the rights
of the city. A young citizen of twenty-five, of mild yet
intrepid temper, calm and yet active, a friend to law
and liberty, without meanness and without arrogance,
and who had within him deep-seated and vigorous
powers,&mdash;this man feared not to provoke a contest
between Geneva and the most formidable of his
neighbours. He was Besan&ccedil;on Hugues, who had just
lost his father and was beginning to enter into public
life. One idea governed him: to maintain the independence
of his country and resist the usurpations of
Savoy, even should it draw upon him the duke’s hatred.
‘In the name of the people,’ he said, ‘I oppose the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
surrender of this artillery to his Highness, the city
cannot spare them.’ The four guns remained at
Geneva, but from that hour Charles III. looked with
an angry eye upon Berthelier, Hugues, and Bonivard.
‘I will be even with them,’ said he.&mdash;‘When I paid
him my respects after the death of my uncle,’ said
Bonivard, ‘his Highness turned up his nose at me.’<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></p>

<p>Charles III., son of Philip Lackland, was not much
like that adventurous prince. When Philip reached
a certain age, he became reformed; and after having
several natural children, he married Margaret of
Bourbon, and on her death Claudine of Penthievre or
Brittany, and in 1496 ascended the throne of Piedmont
and Savoy. Charles III., his son by the second
wife, rather took after his grandfather Duke Louis;
like him he was steady but weak, submissive to his
wife, and inherited from Monsieur only his bursts of
passion. His understanding was not large; but his
councillors who were very able made up for this.
One single thought seemed to possess him: to annex
Geneva to Savoy. It was almost his whole policy.
By grasping after Geneva he lost his principalities.
&AElig;sop’s fable of the dog and the shadow has never been
better illustrated.</p>

<p>In 1515 everything seemed favourable to the plans
of this prince. The marriage of the Princess Philiberta,
which had not been solemnised in 1513 in
consequence of her youth, was about to take place.
The Bishop of Geneva, then at Rome for the Lateran
Council, backed his cousin’s demand touching the
temporal sovereignty. The ministers of Charles, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
court, nobility, and priests, all of them pressed the
annexation of Geneva. Was not that city the market
for the provinces neighbouring on Savoy? Was it not
necessary for the strategic defence of the duchy?
Claude de Seyssel, a skilful diplomatist, author of the
<i>Monarchie de France</i>, ‘a bitter despiser of every
republic, and soon after made archbishop of Turin,
was continually repeating to the duke that if Geneva
remained <i>in</i> his territory without being <i>of</i> it, Savoy
would incur great danger.’ ‘Truly,’ said Bonivard,
when he heard of Seyssel’s arguments, ‘there is no
need to push his Highness to make him run. He
has begun to beat the tabor, and is now going to open
the dance.’<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></p>

<p>But would the pope take part in the dance? Would
he surrender up Geneva to Savoy? That was the
question. Leo X. loved wealth, the arts, pleasure,
and all the enjoyments of life; he was generous,
liberal, prodigal even, and did not care much for
business. He had prepared a magnificent palace in
the city of the popes and of the C&aelig;sars, for Julian
and his young wife. Entertainments of unusual
splendour celebrated the union of the Medici with
the old family of Humbert of the white hand. ‘I
will spare no expense,’ Leo said, and in fact these
rejoicings cost him the enormous sum of 15,000
ducats.</p>

<p>How could a pontiff always occupied in plundering
others to enrich and exalt his own kindred, compromise
so glorious an alliance in order to maintain the
independence of an unknown city in the wild country
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
of the Alps? Besides, the situation at Geneva was
disquieting; the free institutions of the city threatened
the temporal power of the bishop, and if that were
destroyed, what would become of his spiritual power?
But if the Duke of Savoy should become sovereign
prince there, he would revoke the insolent liberties of
the citizens, and thus save the episcopal prerogative.
Such had been the history of most cities in the middle
ages: was it also to be that of Geneva?<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> Lorenzo
de’ Medici had been accustomed to say: ‘My son
Julian is good; my son John (Leo X.) is crafty; my
son Peter is mad.’ Leo thought he was displaying considerable
tact by sacrificing Geneva to the glory of
the Medici and the ambition of Savoy. ‘The Duke
of Savoy,’ says a catholic historian, ‘took advantage of
this circumstance (the marriage) to procure a bull
confirming the transfer of the temporal authority.’<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a>
Charles III. triumphed. He had reached the end
which his predecessors had been aiming at for centuries:
he had done more than Peter, surnamed Charlemagne;
more than Amadeus the Great; he fancied
himself the hero of his race. ‘I am sovereign lord of
Geneva in temporal matters,’ he told everybody. ‘I
obtained it from our holy father the reigning pope.’
But what would they say at Geneva? Would the
ancient republic meekly bow its head beneath the
Savoyard yoke?<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a></p>

<p>The whole city was in commotion when this important
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
news arrived. Berthelier, Bonivard, Hugues,
Vandel, Bernard, even the most catholic of the citizens,
exasperated at such a usurpation, hurried to and fro,
conversing eagerly and especially blaming the pontiff.
‘The power of the popes,’ they said, ‘is not over
principalities but over sins&mdash;it is for the purpose of
correcting vices, and not to be masters of sovereigns
and peoples, that they have received the keys of the
kingdom of heaven.’ There was at Geneva a small
number of scholars (Bonivard was one) who opened
the dusty tomes of their libraries in search of arguments
against the papal resolution. Did not St. Bernard
say to Pope Eugene: ‘To till the vineyard of
the Lord, to root out the noxious plants, is your
task.... You need not a sceptre but a hoe.’<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></p>

<p>On the 25th of May a deputation from the council
waited on the bishop. ‘My lord,’ said the first
syndic, ‘we conjure you to leave the community
in the same state as your predecessors transmitted
it to you, enjoying its rightful customs and ancient
franchises.’ The bishop was embarrassed: on the
one hand he feared to irritate men whose energy was
not unknown to him, and on the other to displease his
cousin whose slave he was; he contented himself with
muttering a few words. The syndics waited upon
the chapter next: ‘Prevent this iniquity,’ they said
to the canons, ‘seeing that it <i>touches</i> you as much
as the city.’ But the reverend fathers, who possessed
fat benefices in the duke’s territory, and feared to
have them confiscated, replied in such complicated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
phrases that nobody could understand them. Both
bishop and canons surrendered Geneva to the man
who claimed to be its master.</p>

<p>The report that the city was decidedly given to Savoy
spread farther and farther every day: people wrote
about it from every quarter. The syndics, moved by
the letters they received, returned to the bishop. ‘It
is now a general rumour,’ said they; ‘protest, my lord,
against these strange reports, so that the usurpation,
although begun, may not be completed.’ The bishop
looked at them, then fixing his hollow, sunken eyes
upon the ground, preserved an obstinate silence.
The syndics withdrew without obtaining anything.
What was to be done now? The last hour of liberty
seemed to have struck in the old republic. The citizens
met one another without exchanging a word;
their pale faces and dejected looks alone expressed
their sorrow. One cry, however, was heard among
them: ‘Since justice is powerless,’ said the most
spirited, ‘we will have recourse to force, and if the
duke is resolved to enter Geneva, he shall pass over
our bodies.’ But the majority were uneasy; knowing
their own weakness and the power of Savoy, they
considered all resistance useless. Old Rome had
destroyed the independence of many a people; new
Rome desired to imitate her.... The city was lost.
Salvation came from a quarter whence no one expected
it.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></p>

<p>The sacred college had assembled, and the princes
of the Church, robed in purple, had examined the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
affair. To deprive a bishop of his temporal principality ...
what a dangerous example for the papacy
itself! Who knows whether princes will not some
day desire to do as much by his Holiness? To
hear them, you would have fancied, that catholicism
would decline and disappear if it did not join the
sceptre of the C&aelig;sars with the shepherd’s crook. The
cardinals resolved that for it to be lawful for a prince
of the Church to alienate his temporal jurisdiction,
it was necessary, ‘first, that subjects be in rebellion
against their prince; second, that the prince be not
strong enough to reduce them; third, that he should
have a better recompense.’ Was this <i>recompense</i> to
be another <i>temporality</i> or simply a pecuniary compensation?
This the documents do not say. In any
case, the sacred college refused its consent to the
papal decision, and the bull was recalled.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a></p>

<p>The duke was surprised and irritated. His counsellors
reassured him: they pointed out to him that,
according to the decision of the cardinals, it only
required a revolt in order to withdraw the temporal
jurisdiction from the bishop. ‘The Genevans, who
are hot-headed and big talkers,’ said they, ‘will
commit some imprudence by means of which we
shall prove to the sacred college that it needs <i>a
stronger shepherd than a bishop</i> to bring them back to
their duty.’ To these representations they proposed
adding certain crafty devices. The judicial officers
of the ducal party would draw up long, obscure,
unintelligible indictments against the citizens; my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
lords the cardinals at Rome, who are indolence
itself, would waive the reading of these tiresome
documents, the matter would be explained to them
<i>viv&acirc; voce</i>; they would be told that the only means
of saving the bishop was to give the duke the
sovereignty over the city. Charles felt comforted
and sent his cousin fresh instructions. ‘Since I
cannot have the tree,’ he said, ‘I wish at least to
taste the fruit. Set about plundering right and left
(<i>ab hoc et ab hac</i>) to fill my treasury.’ By means
of this plundering, the Genevans would be irritated;
they would be driven to take up arms, and
thus the duke would succeed in confiscating their
independence with the consent not only of the pope
but of the cardinals also.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a>

<span class="small">BERTHELIER AND THE YOUTH OF GENEVA AROUSED BY THE
BISHOP’S VIOLENCE.<br />

(1515-1517.)</span></h2>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> bishop, the humble servant of the duke, prepared
to act according to his instructions. Charles had
set a trustee over him, who allowed him only what was
absolutely necessary for his bare maintenance. One
day, when an eminent citizen asked him a favour,
John of Savoy exclaimed: ‘I have only my crozier
and my mitre, the property belongs to the duke. He
is bishop and abbot.’ ... ‘For,’ adds the chronicler,
‘the duke being very rapacious, John was forced to
give the rein to his Highness’s extortioners.’ They
imposed excessive fines; where in the inferior courts
the penalty should not exceed sixty sols, they exacted
fifty livres. No prince ever made such efforts to
suppress revolt as the bastard to foment it. He
was almost brave in his devices for losing his principality,
but it was the result of servility. He deprived
the syndics of their judicial functions; he threw men
into prison to avenge private or imaginary offences.
The people began to murmur: ‘A singular shepherd
this!’ they said. ‘He is not satisfied with shearing
his flock, but tears and worries them with his dogs.’
The partisans of Savoy were delighted. By one of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
these exploits the bastard very nearly revolutionised
Geneva.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></p>

<p>Claude Vandel was one of the most respected
citizens of Geneva. A distinguished lawyer, a man
of noble character and spotless integrity, of retiring
and respectful manners, but also of great courage, he
protected at his own expense the weak and poor
against the violence of the great. A citizen having
been unjustly prosecuted by a bishop’s officer, Vandel
undertook his defence and so enraged the prelate
that he swore to be revenged on him. But how was
he to begin? The people respected Vandel; his ancestors
had filled the highest offices in the State; his wife,
Mie du Fresnoir, belonged to a good family allied to
the Chatillons and other Savoyard houses of the best
blood. Moreover Vandel possessed four sons, united
by the closest affection, full of veneration for their
father, and all destined one day to be called to important
duties. Robert, the eldest, was a syndic;
Thomas, a canon, procurator-fiscal, and one of the first
priests that embraced the Reformation; of the two
youngest, who were still youths, Hugo was afterwards
the representative of the republic in Switzerland,
and Peter captain-general. It was known at the
bishop’s palace that Vandel’s sons would not permit
a hand to be laid upon their father; and
that even the people would take up his defence.
Nevertheless it was decided to make the Genevans
bend under the yoke of absolute authority. Thomas,
who was then incumbent of Morges, hurried to Geneva
on hearing of the design that threatened his father. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
was a man of most decided character, and ‘handled
the sword better than his breviary.’ When they
learned what were the bishop’s intentions, his brothers
and he had felt in their hearts one of those sudden
and unlooked-for impulses that proceed from the
noblest of affections, and they swore to make their
bodies a rampart for their father. The bishop and
his courtiers had recourse to stratagem. Vandel
was in the country, Robert and Thomas keeping
guard beside him. A rumour was set afloat that the
bishop’s bailiffs would come at nightfall and seize
the lawyer. Consequently, ‘before night came on,’
Robert and Thomas went out to watch for the men
who were to carry off their father. But these, instead
of leaving at the appointed hour, had started
earlier and hidden themselves near the house. As
soon as it was dark they left their hiding-place,
and while Vandel’s sons and friends were looking for
them in another direction, they seized the republican
Claude, bound him, took him into the city by a secret
postern, and conducted him along a subterranean
passage to the bishop’s prison.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></p>

<p>The next morning, Vandel’s sons ran in great distress
to their friends and appealed to the people
whom they met. They represented that the syndics
alone had the right of trial in criminal matters, and
that by arresting their father the bishop had trampled
the franchises of the city under foot. The people
were excited, the council assembled; the syndics
went to the bishop and called upon him to let Vandel
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
go, or else hand over to them, his lawful judges, the
papers in his case.</p>

<p>‘My council,’ the bishop answered, ‘will examine
whether this <i>arrest</i> is contrary to your liberties, in
which case I will amend what is to be amended.’
Even the episcopal council decided for Vandel’s discharge;
but the bastard obstinately refused.</p>

<p>The anger of the people now grew fiercer against
the citizens who had accepted the bishop’s pensions.</p>

<p>‘The bishop knows very well,’ they said, ‘that some
of them prefer his money to the liberties of the city.
Why should he fear to infringe our rights, when
traitors have sold them to him?’ Thomas Vandel,
the priest, the most ardent of the family, hastened to
Berthelier. ‘The irritation is general,’ he said, ‘and
yet they hesitate. Nobody dares bell the cat.’ Berthelier
joined Vandel’s sons, and their bold representations,
as well as the murmurs of the people,
aroused the syndics. The day (June 29) was already
far advanced; but that mattered not, and at the
unusual hour of eight in the evening the council
met, and ‘all the most eminent in the city to the
number of about three hundred,’ joined the assembly.
The people gathered in crowds and filled the hall.</p>

<p>Berthelier was present. He was still governor of
Peney, the bishop’s gift; and the latter made merry
with his courtiers at having put ‘a bone in his mouth
to prevent his barking.’ There were some Genevans
who looked frowningly upon him, as if that great
citizen had betrayed his country. But Berthelier was
calm, his countenance determined: he was prepared to
strike the first blow. The syndics described the illegal
act of the bishop; the sons of the prisoner called
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
upon them to avenge their father; and Berthelier
exclaimed: ‘To maintain the liberties of the city, we
must act without fear; let us rescue the citizen whom
traitors have seized.’ John Taccon, captain-general,
and at the same time a pensioner of the bishop’s,
stopped him: ‘Gently,’ said he, ‘if we do as you
advise, certain inconveniences may follow.’ Berthelier
in great excitement exclaimed: ‘Now the pensioners
are showing themselves!’ At these words Taccon
could not contain himself: ‘It was you,’ he said, ‘yes,
you, who showed me the way to take a pension.’
On hearing this reproach Berthelier pulled out the
bishop’s letters appointing him governor of Peney,
and which he had brought with him to the council,
and tore them in pieces before the meeting, saying:
‘Since I showed you the way to take them, look, I
now show you the way to resign them.’ These words
acted like an electric shock. A cry of ‘No more pensions!’
was raised on all sides. All the pensioners declared
themselves ready to tear up their letters-patent
like Berthelier. The commotion was very great. ‘Toll
the bell for the general council,’ cried some. ‘No,
no,’ said the more prudent, ‘it would be the signal for
a general outbreak, and the people would right themselves.’<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></p>

<p>Something however must be done. A portion of
the assembly went off to the bishop’s palace, and began
to shout for the prelate: ‘Release the prisoner!’ But
the bishop did not appear; the doors and windows of
the palace remained closely barred. The irritation
grew general. ‘As the bishop will not show himself,’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
they said, ‘we must assemble the people.’ Upon this
John Bernard, whose three sons played an important
part in the Reformation, ran off to the tower of St.
Pierre to ring the bell for the general council. But the
priests, anticipating what would happen, had fastened
the belfry door. Bernard did not renounce his purpose:
he caught up a huge hammer and was beginning
to batter the door, when some citizens came up and
stopped him. They had just learned that the bastard
did not appear because, dreading the fury of the
people, he had left Geneva in great haste. One
thought consoled the bishop in all his terror: ‘Surely
here is an argument that will convince the sacred
college: my people are in revolt!’ But the episcopal
council thought differently: Vandel’s arrest was
illegal, and they restored him to liberty. From that
hour the bishop’s hatred grew more deadly against
those who would not bend to his tyranny.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a></p>

<p>The energy displayed by the citizens showed the
bastard what he would have to expect if he laid hands
on their independence. His creatures resolved therefore
to set to work in another way: to enervate
this proud and resolute people, and with that view
to encourage superstition and profligacy in Geneva.
Superstition would prevent the citizens from thinking
about truth and reform, while profligacy would make
them forget their dignity, their rights, and their
dearest liberties.</p>

<p>At the commencement of 1517&mdash;the year when the
Reformation began in Germany&mdash;a bare-footed friar,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
named Thomas, came and preached at Geneva in
<i>Italian</i>, and the people who did not understand a
word listened to him with admiration. The Virgin
Mary, the saints, and the departed were his ordinary
theme. Bonivard shrugged his shoulders, saying:
‘He is a mere idiot with his cock-and-bull stories!’
The friar proceeded next to work miracles; sick persons
were brought to him after service; he blessed
them right and left, and many returned home cured.
‘What do you say to that?’ triumphantly asked some
bigots of the sceptical prior. ‘Why, <i>imaginatio facit
casum</i>, it is the effect of imagination,’ he replied.
‘The fools believe so firmly that he will heal them,
that the cure follows; but it does not last long, and
many return worse than they came.’ The honourable
councillors, befooled like the rest, sent the friar
‘princely presents.’</p>

<p>As superstition did not suffice, entertainments
and debauchery were added. Duke Philibert the
Fair, who visited Geneva in 1498 with his bastard
brother Ren&eacute;, had already employed this means of
subduing the Genevans. ‘Go,’ said he to his noblest
lords, ‘and win over all these shopkeepers and
mechanics by being on the most familiar footing with
them.’ The Savoyard nobles, affably accosting the
Genevans, used to sit down with them in the taverns,
drink, laugh, and sing with them, bewildering the
simple by their high-flown language and ‘grand
airs.’ They concealed their subtle treachery under
fine phrases; and throwing off all shame, they even
permitted looks and gestures of abominable lewdness,
infecting the hearts with impurity, and corrupting the
young. The priests, far from opposing this depravity,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
were the first to give way to it. A shameful wantonness
engendered criminal excesses which would have
brought ruin on those who indulged in them and on
the city itself. Effrontery stalked in the streets.
The strangers who stopped in Geneva exclaimed:&mdash;‘It
is indeed a city sunk to the eyes in pleasure.
Church, nobles, and people are devoted to every
kind of excess. You see nothing but sports, dances,
masquerades, feasts, lewdness, and consequently, strife
and contention. Abundance has generated insolence,
and assuredly Geneva deserves to be visited with the
scourge of God.’<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a></p>

<p>Philip Berthelier, a man of indomitable courage,
untiring activity, enthusiastic for independence and
the ancient rights of liberty, but infected with the
general disease, now put the plan he had conceived
into execution, and resolved to turn against Savoy
the dissolute habits with which she had endowed his
country. He took part in all their feasts, banquets,
and debaucheries; drank, laughed, and sang with the
youth of Geneva. There was not an entertainment
at which he was not present: ‘<i>Bonus civis, malus
homo</i>, a good citizen, but a bad man,’ they said of
him. ‘Yes, <i>malus homo</i>,’ he replied; ‘but since good
citizens will not risk their comforts in an enterprise
of which they despair, I must save liberty by means
of madmen.’ He employed his practical understanding
and profound sagacity in winning men over,<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a>
and he attained the end he had set before him. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
assemblies of the Genevan youth immediately changed
in character. Philibert the Fair had made them a
school of slavery; Philibert Berthelier made them a
school of liberty. Those who opposed the usurpations
of the Savoyard princes, boldly held their meetings
at these joyous and noisy feasts. The great
citizen, as if he had been invested with some magic
charm, had entirely changed the Genevan mind, and,
holding it in his hand, made it do whatever he
pleased. Sarcasms were heaped upon the bishop and
the duke’s partisans, and every jest was greeted with
loud bursts of laughter and applause. If any episcopal
officer committed an illegality, information was given
to these strange parliaments, and these redressors of
wrong undertook to see the victim righted. When
the Savoyard party put themselves without the law,
the Genevan party did the same, and the war began.</p>

<p>Had Berthelier taken the right course? Could the
independence of Geneva be established on such a
foundation? Certainly not; true liberty cannot exist
without justice, and consequently without a moral
change that comes from God. So long as ‘young
Geneva’ loved diversion above everything, the bishop
and the duke might yet lay hands upon her. Such
was the love of pleasure in the majority of these
youths, that they would seize the bait with eager
impetuosity if it were only dropped with sufficient
skill. ‘They felt that the hook was killing them,’
said a writer of the sixteenth century; but they had
not strength to pull it out. This strength was to
come from on high. The human mind, so inconstant
and so weak, found in God’s Word the power
it needed, and which the light of the fifteenth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
century could never have given them. The Reformation
was necessary to liberty, because it was necessary
to morality. When the protestant idea declined in
some countries, as in France for instance, the human
mind lost its energy also, profligacy once more overran
society; and that highly endowed nation, after
having caught a glimpse of a magnificent dawn, fell
back into the thick night of the traditional power of
Rome and the despotism of the Valois and Bourbons.
Liberty has never been firmly established except
among a people where the Word of God reigns.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br />

<span class="small">THE OPPOSING PARTIES PREPARE FOR BATTLE.<br />

(1516-1517.)</span></h2>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">As</span> a new and powerful opposition was forming in
Geneva, it became necessary for the duke and the
bishop to unite more closely. About this time an
incident of little importance was nearly setting them
at variance, and thus accelerating the emancipation of
the city.</p>

<p>One day as the gouty bastard, stretched on a
couch, was suffering cruelly from his disease, he
heard a noise in the street. ‘What is the matter?’
he asked.&mdash;‘They are taking a thief to be hanged,’
replied the old woman that tended him, who added:
‘If your Lordship would but pardon him, he would
pray for your health all the days of his life.’ The
bishop, carried away by that fancy of sick people
which makes them try everything in the hope that
it will cure them, said: ‘Be it so, let them set him
at liberty.’ It was the custom&mdash;a strange custom&mdash;in
Geneva for the syndics to hand over to the vidame
the men they had condemned; the vidame transferred
them to the governor of Gaillard in Savoy, and
the governor to the executioner. The executioner,
attended by the governor, was about to hang the
man when the bishop’s officers brought an order to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
release him. ‘I am the servant of my most dread
lord the Duke of Savoy,’ said the governor, ‘and
I shall discharge the duty intrusted to me.’ It was
agreed, however, that the execution should be put off,
and the bishop called his council together to examine
whether he had not the right to pardon a malefactor
even when he was already in the hands of the officer
empowered to execute him. There was among the
members of the episcopal council a man of noble
character destined to take a place in the history of
Geneva by the side of Berthelier and even above
him. Aim&eacute; L&eacute;vrier, judge in the criminal court,
son of a former syndic, knew no rule but the law,
and had no motive but duty. Serious, calm, full
of dignity, endowed with the wisdom of a Nestor,
he was decided and energetic in carrying the laws
into execution, and as soon as his conscience spoke,
he obeyed it in his humble sphere with the impetuosity
of an Achilles, if one may compare small
things with great. The turbulence of the people
and the self-will of princes found him equally unbending.
He saw in this little incident the great
question between the legitimate authority of the
bishop and the usurpations of the duke. ‘The
prince of Geneva,’ he said, ‘has the right to pardon
a criminal, even if he is on the territory of
Savoy and at the foot of the scaffold.’ And then,
wishing to seize the opportunity of showing that the
duke was servant in Geneva and not master, he left
the hall, went up to the culprit, cut his bonds, took
him by the hand, and, leading him to the bishop,
said to the poor wretch: ‘Give thanks to God and
my lord;’ and after that, boldly set him at liberty.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
But the bishop, who had never imagined the existence
of such power, began to tremble already.</p>

<p>They had not indeed long to wait for the duke’s
anger. If he had given his cousin the diocese of
Geneva, it was that he might himself acquire the
supreme power; and here was the bishop seized with
a fit of independence and going so far as to contest
his rights as vidame, his functions as executioner!...
He would take advantage of this strange boldness to
put the bastard in his right place, get rid of L&eacute;vrier,
destroy the remnant of liberty still to be found in
the city, and establish the ducal authority therein.
The seignior of La Val d’Is&egrave;re, attended by two
other commissioners, arrived at Geneva in order to
execute his Highness’s pleasure. Striding haughtily
into the bishop’s palace, he addressed the bastard
rudely on the part of the angry duke. The bishop
was lavish of salutations, attentions, and respect,
but all to no purpose. La Val d’Is&egrave;re, who had
learnt his lesson well, raised his voice still higher:
Wretched bastard! (he said) what did he want with
pardoning a man they were going to hang? The
poor prelate was on the rack and more dead than alive;
at last the ducal envoy having finished his severe
reprimand, the bishop tremblingly excused himself,
‘like our father Adam when he threw the blame on
Eve,’ says Bonivard. ‘It was one L&eacute;vrier, a judge
and doctor of laws, who did it,’ said he. The seignior
of La Val d’Is&egrave;re gave the bishop to understand
that instead of indulging any longings for independence,
he ought to unite with the duke in combating
the spirit of liberty in Geneva.</p>

<p>To a certain extent, however, the ducal envoy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
admitted the prelate’s excuse; he knew his weakness,
and saw that another will than his own had acted in
this business. He informed the duke of L&eacute;vrier’s
misdeed, and from that hour this intrepid judge
became odious to the court of Turin, and was doomed
to destruction. The Savoyards said that as he had
rescued the thief from the gallows, he ought to be
hanged in his place. The duke and his ministers
were convinced that every attempt to enslave Geneva
would fail, so long as it contained such an energetic
defender of the law. The evening of the day when
La Val d’Is&egrave;re had reprimanded the bishop, the ducal
envoy, with one of his colleagues and the vidame,
supped at the priory of St. Victor: the ambassador
was Bonivard’s cousin, and had purposely gone
to visit him. He desired to make his cousin a
devoted agent of Savoy in Geneva, and to employ
him, by way of prelude, in the arrest of the recalcitrant
judge. After supper, La Val d’Is&egrave;re took the
prior aside, and began to compliment him highly.
‘My dear cousin,’ said he, ‘the duke has not in all
his states a man better fitted than you to do him a
service. I know you; I observed you when you
were studying beyond the mountains, an intelligent
fellow, a skilful swordsman, always ready to execute
any deed of daring if it would render your friends a
service. Your ancestors were loyal servants of the
house of Savoy, and my lord expects you will show
yourself worthy of them.’ The astonished Bonivard
made no reply. Then La Val d’Is&egrave;re explained to him
how he could aid the duke in his schemes against
Geneva, adding that at this very moment he might
do him an important service. There was Aim&eacute;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
L&eacute;vrier, a determined malcontent, a rebel like his
father, whom it was necessary to arrest.... La
Val d’Is&egrave;re communicated his plot to Bonivard.
Aim&eacute; L&eacute;vrier went ordinarily to pay his devotions
at the church of Our Lady of Grace, near the bridge
of Arve. Bonivard would follow him, seize him
the moment he came near the church, and, holding
him by the throat, cross the bridge with him, and
deliver him up to the ducal soldiers, who would be
on the other side ready to receive him. ‘This will be
an easy task for you, dear cousin,’ added the ambassador;
‘everybody knows your readiness and your
prowess.’ ... La Val d’Is&egrave;re added that Bonivard
would thus gain two advantages: first, he would be
revenged on the bishop whom he loved but little;
and second, he would receive a handsome reward
from my lord of Savoy. It was a singular idea to
intrust this outrage to the prior of a monastery; yet
it was in accordance with the manners of the day.
Bonivard’s interests and family traditions would have
induced him to serve Savoy; but he had an enlightened
understanding and an independent spirit.
He belonged to the new times. ‘Ever since I began
to read history,’ he said, ‘I have always preferred a
republican to a monarchical state, and especially to
those where the throne is hereditary.’ The duke
would have given him honours and riches in abundance,
whilst he received from the cause which he
embraced only poverty and a dungeon: still he never
hesitated. The love of liberty had taken possession
of that distinguished man, and he was always faithful
to it: whatever may have been his weaknesses, this is
a glory which cannot be taken from him. Bonivard
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
wished to decline the proposal without however
irritating the ambassador too much. He pointed to
his robes, his prayer-book, his monks, his priory, and
assigning these as a reason, he said: ‘Handling the
sword is no longer my business; I have changed it
for the breviary.’ Upon this La Val d’Is&egrave;re in great
disappointment became angry and said: ‘Well, then, I
swear I will go myself to-night and take L&eacute;vrier in
his bed, and carry him tied hand and foot into Savoy.’
Bonivard looked at him with a smile: ‘Will you
really make the attempt?’ he asked; ‘shake hands
then.’ The ambassador thinking he was won over
gave him his hand. ‘Are you going to make preparation
for the affair?’&mdash;‘No, cousin,’ replied Bonivard
with a bow, ‘I know the people of Geneva; they are
not indulgent, I warn you, and I shall go and set aside
thirty florins to have a mass said for your soul
to-morrow.’ The ambassador left him in great
anger.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a></p>

<p>Bonivard perceived that L&eacute;vrier’s life was in
danger. At that time people supped early; the
prior waited until nightfall, and then leaving his
monastery in disguise, he passed stealthily through
the streets, and entering the house of his friend the
judge, told him everything. L&eacute;vrier in his turn
ran to Berthelier. ‘Oh, oh!’ said the latter, who
was captain of the city, ‘my lords of Savoy want to
be masters here! we will teach them it is not so easy.’</p>

<p>At this moment news was brought the syndics that
some lansquenets were at the Vengeron (half a league
from the city on the right shore of the lake) and preparing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
to enter the faubourg of St. Gervais: it was
clear that Savoy desired to carry off the judge. The
syndics ordered Berthelier to keep watch all night
under arms. He assembled the companies, and the
men marched through the streets in close order with
drums beating, passing and repassing the house of
the vidame, Aymon Conseil, where the ambassadors
were staying.</p>

<p>The seignior of La Val d’Is&egrave;re, with his two colleagues
the Sieur J. de Crans and Peter Lambert,
expected every moment to be attacked by these armed
men. They called to mind the mass for the dead of
which Bonivard had spoken, and altogether passed a
horrible night. Towards the morning the city grew
calm, and it was scarcely light when the envoys of
Savoy, ordering their horses to be saddled, rode out
by a secret door of which the bishop had the key, and
hastened to report to their master.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></p>

<p>Notwithstanding their precipitate retreat one of
the objects of their mission was attained. The deputies
from Savoy did not quit Geneva alone; the bastard
was still more frightened than they; fear drove away
the gout, he left his bed, and taking with him the
Count of Genevois, the duke’s brother, he hurried over
the mountains to Turin, in order to pacify his terrible
cousin. The latter was extremely irritated. It
was not enough to encroach on his rights, they also
forced his envoys to flee from Geneva. The bastard
spared no means to justify himself; he crouched at
Charles’s feet. He was the most to be pitied, he said;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
these Genevans frightened him day and night. ‘I
will forget everything,’ said the prince to him at last,
‘provided you assist me in bringing these republicans
to reason.’ It was what the prior of St. Victor
had foreseen. ‘Just as Herod and Pilate agreed
in their dark designs,’ he said, ‘so do the duke
and the bishop agree for the ruin of Geneva.’&mdash;‘Cousin,’
continued the duke, ‘let us understand one
another: in your fold there are certain <i>dogs</i> that bark
very loudly and defend your sheep very stoutly; you
must get rid of them.... I don’t mean only L&eacute;vrier
the son&mdash;there is L&eacute;vrier the father and Berthelier
also, against whom you must sharpen your teeth.’&mdash;‘The
elder L&eacute;vrier,’ answered the bastard, ‘is a sly
and cunning fox, who knows how to keep himself out
of the trap; as for Berthelier, he is hot, choleric, and
says outright what he thinks: we shall have a far
better chance of catching him; and when he is done
for, it will be an easy matter with the others.’ In
this way the princes of Savoy, meeting in the duke’s
cabinet in the palace of Turin, conspired the ruin
of Geneva, and plotted the death of its best citizens.
Charles the <i>Good</i> was the cruellest and most obstinate
of the three. ‘Let us play the game seriously,’ he
repeated; ‘we must have them dead or alive.’ The
duke, the count, and the bishop arranged their parts,
and then the <i>wolves</i> (it was the name Bonivard gave
them) waited a good opportunity for falling on the
<i>dogs</i>.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a></p>

<p>While they were making these preparations at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
Turin to crush liberty, others were preparing at
Geneva to fight and to die for her. Both parties took
up arms: the contest could not fail to be severe, and
the issue important to Geneva and to society. Two
friends especially did not lose sight of the approaching
struggle. Berthelier inclined to the revival of
Geneva from democratic motives; Bonivard, from a
love of learning, philosophy, and light. Seated opposite
each other in the priory of St. Victor, with the mild
sparkling wine of the country on the table, they discoursed
about the new times. Bonivard possessed an
indescribable attraction for Berthelier. The young
prior whose mind was full of grace, simplicity, poetry,
imagination, and also of humour, was waking up with
the sixteenth century, and casting an animated glance
upon nature and the world. His style indicates his character:
he always found the strongest, the most biting
expressions, without either the shades of delicacy or
the circuitousness of subtlety. There were however
elevated parts in him: he could be enthusiastic for an
idea. A thought passing through his mind would
call up high aspirations in his soul and bring accents
of eloquence to his lips. But, generally, men displeased
him. A well-bred gentleman, a keen and
graceful wit, a man of the world, he found the townspeople
about him vulgar, and did not spare them
the sting of his satire. When Berthelier, in the midst
of the uproar of a tavern, shook the youths of Geneva
warmly by the hand, and enlisted them for the great
campaign of independence, Bonivard would draw
back with embarrassment and put on his gloves.
‘These petty folks,’ he said with some contempt, ‘only
like justice in others; and as for the rich tradesmen,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
they prefer the feasts and the money of the Savoyard
nobles to the charms of independence.’ He was
inclined to suspect evil: this was one of the disagreeable
features in his character. Even Besan&ccedil;on
Hugues was, in his eyes, nothing but pride, hidden
under the mask of a citizen. Bonivard, like Erasmus,
laughed at everybody and everything, except two:
like him he was fond of letters, and still more fond
of liberty. At Geneva he was the man of the Renaissance,
as Calvin was the man of the Reformation.
He overcame his antipathies, sat down at table with
the young Genevans, scattered brilliant thoughts in
their conversations, and kindled in their understanding
a light that was never to be extinguished. Frivolous
and grave, amiable and affectionate, studious
and trifling, Bonivard attacked the old society, but he
did not love the new. He scourged the enormities
of the monks, but he was alarmed at the severe
doctrines of the Reformation. He desired to bury
the past joyously, but he did not know what future
to set up in its place.</p>

<p>Berthelier, who fancied he knew, explained his
plans to his friends in their familiar colloquies. The
liberty of the Italian republics&mdash;a selfish liberty, full
of discord and faction&mdash;had come to an end; a more
noble, more vital, more durable liberty was destined
to appear. But neither the politic Berthelier nor
the &aelig;sthetic Bonivard thought of the new element
which in new times was to give life to modern
liberties: this element was a strong faith, it was the
authority of God, held up on high, that was destined
to consolidate society after the great earthquake
it would have to go through. After Berthelier the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
republican, after Bonivard the classic, another man
was to appear, <i>tertium genus</i>, a third kind, as they
said at the time when paganism and Judaism disappeared
before the Gospel. A Christian hero, boldly
standing erect above the volcano of popular passions,
was called in the midst of the convulsions of
popery to lay in Geneva the foundations of enlightened
society, inflexible morality, unyielding faith,
and thus to save the cause of liberty. The work
of Calvin, thus coming after that of Berthelier and
Bonivard, no doubt presents a very strange juxtaposition;
but three centuries have shown its necessity.
The Reformation is indispensable to the emancipation
of nations.</p>

<p>Berthelier, Bonivard, and their friends turned their
eyes in another direction. ‘Have done with banquets
and dances,’ said Berthelier to his friend; ‘we must
organise young Geneva into a defensive league.’
‘Yes, let us march onwards,’ replied Bonivard,
‘and God will give a good issue to our bold enterprise!’ ...
Berthelier stretched out his hand. ‘Comrade,’
he said, ‘your hand.’<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> Then, as he held
Bonivard’s hand in his, he was touched with deep
emotion: a cloud passed over his face, and he added:
‘But know that for the liberty of Geneva, you will
lose your benefice, and I ... I shall lose my head.’
‘He told me that a hundred times,’ added the prior
of St. Victor, who has handed down this conversation
to us. The gloomy foreboding was but too amply
fulfilled.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.<br />

<span class="small">ASSEMBLY, AGITATION, AND COMEDY OF THE PATRIOTS.<br />

(1516-1517.)</span></h2>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Without</span> delay Berthelier entered upon the
work to which he had sworn to devote his life.
Wishing to prepare it carefully, he invited the most
ardent of the young Genevans to confer with him on
the salvation of the country. He did not select for
this meeting some lonely field, above the shores of the
lake, as the Gr&uuml;tli: he had to deal with the inhabitants
of a city and not with the children of the mountains.
He therefore took a hall in the principal square of
the city, la Place du Molard, then almost washed by
the waters of the river, and appointed a time for the
meeting when the streets were most thronged. About
twilight one afternoon, probably in 1516 (it is difficult
to fix precisely the date of this important
meeting<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a>), Berthelier, and then a few other patriots,
set out for the Molard: they came from the Rue
du Rhone, la Rive, and from the Cit&eacute;; those who came
from the upper part of the town passed down the
Rue du Perron. As they walked, they conversed of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
the tyranny of the bishop and the plots of the
princes of Savoy. One of those who appeared to
have the most influence was Amadeus de Joye, the
son of distinguished, upright, and honourable parents,
who had brought him up virtuously. The public
voice, while proclaiming him ‘a merry fellow,’ added
that he was honest and straightforward, and connected
with all the good men of the city: he exercised the
honourable vocation of druggist and apothecary, and
had always enjoyed a good reputation in his business.
Not far from him was Andrew Navis: a change had
taken place in the son of the procurator-fiscal. The
cause of liberty had dawned upon his ardent soul in all
its beauty: in it he fancied he had found the unknown
good he had sought so eagerly; his imagination
had been inflamed, his heart moved, and leaving
the Savoyard party, of which his father was one of
the chiefs, he rushed with all his natural impetuosity
to the side of independence. One of his
friends, John Biderman, surnamed Blanchet, had accompanied
him, a young man about twenty-four years
old. Full of natural wit, disliking work, very fond
of fun, Blanchet ‘trotted up and down,’ picked up all
the news, repeated it at random, and meddled in
everybody’s business. He had, however, at bottom a
sensitive heart, and the tyranny of the bishop provoked
him. Berthelier, who was among the earliest arrivals,
scanned attentively the young people and the earnest
men who had joined them, and experienced a feeling
of happiness at the sight. There was in him a being
superior to the follies of banquets. The daily routine,
the small passions, the vulgarity of mind, life such as
he had hitherto known it, wearied him. At last he
had before him an assembly brought together for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
noble cause of independence; and for that reason
he affectionately pressed the hand of all comers. At
this moment the bell rang for vespers at Magdalen
old church, and was distinctly heard at the Molard.
There were present with Berthelier about fifty citizens&mdash;a
small meeting, and yet more numerous than
that of Walter F&uuml;rst and his friends. Besides, did
not all noble hearts in Geneva beat in harmony with
those of the fifty patriots?<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a></p>

<p>They gathered in a circle round Berthelier, and
stood silent; the heroic citizen reminded them that
from the most remote times Geneva had been free;
but that for one or two centuries the princes of Savoy
had been trying to enslave it, and that the duke only
waited for the favourable opportunity to impose his
usurped sovereignty upon their country. Then fixing
his noble look upon his audience, he asked them if
they wished to transmit to their children not liberty
but ... slavery? The citizens answered No, and
demanded anxiously how the liberties of the city
could effectually be saved? ‘How!’ said Berthelier.
‘By being united, by forgetting our private quarrels,
by opposing with one mind every violation of our
rights. We have all the same franchises, let us all
have the same heart. If the bishop’s officers lay
hands on one of us, let all the others defend him
with their swords, their nails, their teeth!’<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> Then he
exclaimed: ‘<i>Who touches one, touches all</i>.’ At these
words they all raised their hands and said: ‘Yes,
yes! one heart, one common cause! Who touches
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
one, touches all!’&mdash;‘Good,’ resumed Berthelier, ‘let
this motto be the name of our alliance, but let us
be faithful to the noble device. If the bishop’s
constables take one of us to prison, let us rescue
him from their hands. If they indulge in criminal
extortions, let us seek out the abominable plunder
even in their houses.’ And then he repeated in a
loud voice: ‘<i>Who touches one, touches all</i>!’ And
yet in the midst of this enthusiasm, the marks of fear
could be seen on some faces. One citizen asked
with considerable uneasiness what they would do if
my lord of Geneva, aided by his Highness, should
attack the city with a strong army? ‘Fear nothing,’
answered Berthelier sharply, ‘we have good friends;’
and he added soon after: ‘I will go to the Swiss, I
will bring back forces, and then ... I will settle
accounts with our adversaries.’<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></p>

<p>From that time the consultations and debates
became more and more frequent: the discussions
went on in private families, at St. Victor’s, in the
houses of the principal citizens, sometimes even in
the public places: men reminded each other of the
customs and franchises of Geneva, and promised to
be mutually faithful.</p>

<p>One day Berthelier, Blanchet, and several other
citizens meeting at Mugnier’s to discourse round
the table about the common interest, unfortunately
brought with them a vile and corrupt fellow, a
creature of the bishop’s, named Carmentrant. They
sat down, the wine circulated, and their heads soon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
became heated: ‘The bishop,’ said one of them, ‘has
sold Geneva to the duke!’&mdash;‘If he breaks his oath,’
said another, ‘his treason does not free us from ours.
When princes trample the law under foot, the citizens
ought to uphold it at any cost.’&mdash;‘We must let the
bishop know,’ added Berthelier, ‘the resolution we
have adopted to defend our independence.’&mdash;‘That
is not easy,’ observed one; ‘how can we approach
my lord and dare tell him all the truth?’&mdash;‘Let us
mask ourselves,’ returned he; ‘we may say hard
things under our masks.... Let us make a <i>momon</i>
at the palace.’ The <i>momon</i> was a bet made by
maskers when playing at dice. P&eacute;colat did not
seem convinced. ‘Leave that to me,’ said Berthelier,
‘I shall find a way of speaking to the prelate.’
Carmentrant listened in silence; he engraved in
his memory every word of the great patriot, ready
to add to them his private interpretations. He asserted
afterwards that Berthelier proposed attacking
the prelate’s life; but the contrary was proved, and
even the farce of the <i>momon</i> was never carried out.
That mattered not; the smallest joke at that time
was metamorphosed into the crime of high treason.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a></p>

<p>Berthelier was not the only person the bishop
caused to be watched; Bonivard, ever sparkling with
wit, gave opportunities to informers. He had at
that time a difference with the bishop about the right
of fishing in the Rhone. One day when walking with
Berthelier and other friends, he complained of the
prelate’s avarice; and then indulging in a joke, he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
said laughingly: ‘If ever I meet him near my
fishery, one or other of us will catch an ugly fish.’
This was made a principal charge against him: he
wished to <i>drown</i> the bishop. They were mistaken:
Bonivard was not a violent character; but he was
ambitious, and, without wishing the bishop any harm,
he secretly aspired to the bishopric. ‘I will go to
Rome,’ said he to one of his intimate friends, ‘and
will not have my beard shaved until I am bishop of
Geneva.’</p>

<p>The court of Turin had not forgotten the famous
decision of the cardinals. A few light words were
not enough to prove to the sacred college that the
people of Geneva were in revolt; an <i>&eacute;meute</i> (as the
Savoyards called it) furnished this party with the
arms they sought.</p>

<p>On the 5th of June, 1517, the only talk throughout
the city was about Messire Gros’ mule, which was dead.
This mule was well known, for the judge rode it whenever
he went on his judicial investigations. People
seriously discussed in the streets and at table the cause
of the death of this famous beast. ‘It is Adrian of
Malvenda,’ said some, ‘that Spaniard whose father
came from Valence la Grande, who, having had a
quarrel with the judge at a dinner party, has hamstrung
the beast.’ ‘No,’ said others, ‘some young
Genevans meeting the judge on his mule and wishing
to frighten him, shouted out and drew their swords:
his servants drew also, and one of them awkwardly
wounded the mule, so that it died.’<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a></p>

<p>Messire Claude Gros or Grossi, judge of the three
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
castles (Peney, Thiez, and Jussy) was one of those
harsh magistrates who are hated by a whole people.
They coupled him in this respect with the procurator-fiscal
Peter Navis; and Berthelier, De Lunes, and
De la Thoy had often threatened both of them with
the vengeance of the patriots. Their hatred against
these two magistrates was such that even Andrew
Navis suffered from it. In vain had he given himself
up heart and soul to the party of liberty; he was
regarded with distrust; and men asked if any good
could come from the house of the procurator-fiscal.
Quite recently Andrew had had a dispute with John
Conod on this subject. The two young people were,
however, reconciled, and the very evening of the day
when the mule died, Conod gave a supper to Navis
and thirty ‘children of Geneva.’ This was the name
they gave to the young men of age to bear arms.
That evening, however, some citizens of riper years
joined them: among whom were Berthelier, J. de
Lunes, E. de la Mare, J. de la Porte, J. de la Thoy,
and J. P&eacute;colat. ‘Gentlemen,’ said Berthelier after
supper, ‘it is a long time since this merry company
has had any fun.’ They were all agreed. Berthelier
delighted in setting his enemies at defiance without
any regard for the consequences. ‘The mule of the
respectable Claude Grossi is dead,’ he continued;
‘that judge is a wretch continually beating after
us and our friends. Let us play him a trick: let
us sell his mule’s skin by auction to the highest
bidder.’ The proposal was adopted by acclamation.
Two or three, however, appeared to wish to
withdraw: ‘Let every one follow the drum on pain of
being fined a gold crown,’ said Berthelier. ‘Agreed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
agreed!’ cried the giddiest of the company. At every
Court and even in the houses of many noblemen it was
the custom to keep <i>fools</i> who had the privilege of telling
the boldest truths with impunity. The Abbot of
Bonmont had one named Master Littlejohn Smallfoot.
Berthelier, desirous of carrying out the practical joke
to the uttermost, sent for Littlejohn. ‘Here,’ said
he, ‘here’s a proclamation for you to cry through the
streets. Forward!’ All marched out with drawn
swords, and, with the drummer at their head, began
to traverse the streets, stopping at every place where
the ordinary publications were made. After a roll of
the drum, Master Littlejohn blew a horn and cried
with his squeaking voice: ‘O yes, this is to give
notice that whoever wishes to buy the skin of a beast,
of the <i>grossest</i> ass in Geneva, and will call at the house
situate between the keeper’s and the H&ocirc;tel de Ville,
it will be sold to the highest bidder.’ ‘Is not that
where Judge <i>Gros</i> lives?’ asked a bystander. ‘Yes, it’s
he that is the <i>gross</i> ass,’ replied another. A general
burst of laughter followed this proclamation. Andrew
Navis in particular indulged in the most noisy demonstrations;
he was bent on showing that he was as
good a patriot as the rest.</p>

<p>The oldest of the patriots were however uneasy:
the elder L&eacute;vrier thought they were going too fast.
‘Ah,’ said he, ‘these young folks will play us a pretty
game!’ ‘Certes,’ added others spitefully, ‘this Berthelier
has a singular talent for stirring up quarrels.’<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a>
The joke was continued through great part of the
night.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span></p>

<p>The next day the judge of the three castles hastened
to lay his complaint before the vidame and the episcopal
council. The vidame called for the arrest of the
guilty parties, who disappeared. Being summoned
by sound of trumpet to appear at the Ch&acirc;teau de l’Ile
under pain of being fined a hundred crowns, they
came out of their hiding-places, and Berthelier
brought an action against the vidame for having
threatened him and his friends with a fine that was
not authorised by the law. The partisans of Savoy
were still more exasperated. ‘There is a conspiracy
against my lord the bishop-prince of Geneva,’ they
exclaimed; ‘he alone has the right of making proclamations.’
They wrote letter after letter to Turin,
and metamorphosed a fool’s jest into the crime of
high treason.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a></p>

<p>The princes of Savoy thought that this was a disorder
by which they might profit. Charles had the
reputation in his hereditary states of being irresolute
in deciding and feeble in executing; but whenever
Geneva was concerned, he ventured upon daring
measures. He gave the order of departure to his
court; took with him one of the most learned diplomatists
of the age, Claude de Seyssel, whom he thought
he should require in the great matters that were to
be transacted, and arrived in Geneva. The vidame,
still irritated by the story of the mule, immediately
presented his homage to the duke, and described the
situation in the gloomiest of colours. ‘You see,’ said
Charles to his councillors, ‘the citizens of Geneva are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
in revolt: it needs <i>a stronger shepherd than a bishop</i>
to bring them back to their duty.’ But Seyssel was a
man of great judgment; he was no novice either in
government or in history; he had studied Thucydides,
Appian, Diodorus, and Xenophon, and even rendered
them into French. He inquired more particularly into
the matter, learned that the notice had been cried by
the Abbot of Bonmont’s fool, and that it was the same
fellow who sang habitually in the streets all the comic
songs produced by the satiric vein of the Genevans.
The diplomatist smiled. ‘This business of the mule
is a mere practical joke,’ he said to the duke; ‘fools,
you know, have the privilege of saying and doing
everything; and as for the band of wags who surrounded
the buffoon, do not let us make these young
men into Cethegi and Catilines. The cardinals will
never consent to give us the temporal sovereignty of
Geneva for such foolery. It would be too much, my
lord, for the first stroke; we must mount to the
pinnacle of sovereignty by shorter steps. This
story will not however be quite useless to us; we will
employ it to sow dissension among our enemies.’ In
fine, the able Seyssel having come to an understanding
with the bishop, the latter summoned to his
presence those of ‘the band,’ that is to say, of the
children of Geneva, whom he thought most pliable.
‘You will gain nothing,’ said Claude de Seyssel to
them, ‘by following a lot of rioters and rebels. In
making this proclamation you committed a wrongful
action, and you might justly receive corporal punishment;
but the bishop is a good prince, inclined to
mercy; he will pardon all of you except Berthelier
and his accomplices. He will even give you office,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
places, and pensions ... only do not consort any
more with seditious people.’ Many, delighted at
getting out of the scrape, thanked Seyssel heartily,
and promised that they should be seen no more among
the disaffected.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> The bastard showed himself more
difficult with regard to the son of his procurator-fiscal:
the bravadoes of Andrew Navis, at the time
of the proclamation about the mule, had aroused
all the prelate’s anger. It would seem that the poor
father dared not intercede for his prodigal son; one of
his friends obtained his pardon, but only after Navis
had promised to reform. He returned to his father’s
office and might be seen constantly poring over the
laws and acts of the exchequer.</p>

<p>This manœuvre having succeeded, and the party
of the independents being thus weakened, the bishop,
the duke, and their friends thought that its head
should be removed: that head was Berthelier. It
was not easy, however, to get rid of him: he was a
member of council, much looked up to in Geneva, and
possessed a skill and energy that baffled all their
attempts. ‘To catch this big partridge,’ said the
bishop, ‘we must first trap a little decoy-bird.’ The
advice appeared excellent. The prince determined
accordingly to catch some friend of Berthelier’s, less
formidable than himself, who by his depositions (for
the <i>question</i> would not be spared) would compromise
the best citizens in Geneva. The decoy would by
his song draw the large birds into the nets spread to
catch them.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<span class="small">P&Eacute;COLAT TORTURED AND BERTHELIER ACCUSED.<br />

(1517.)</span></h2>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Among</span> the best patriots of Geneva was John
P&eacute;colat, whom we have already met at the
mule supper. He had not Berthelier’s strength of
character, but he had spirit. A prey by turns to
enthusiasm and fear, at times indulging in the most
courageous acts or the most culpable weakness, subject
to the blackest melancholy or to fits of the maddest
humour, P&eacute;colat was at once a hero and a jester. His
social position offered the same contrasts. One of his
ancestors had been syndic in 1409, another councillor
in 1474; in 1508 his father had exercised the highest
functions in the State, and he was himself one of the
Council of Fifty; he was well instructed, understood
Latin, and yet was a hosier by trade. It is true that
at this time we often find traders invested with the
highest offices; it is one of the peculiarities of democratic
manners; and we meet with examples of it in
modern society. An accident which deprived him of
the use of his right arm, compelled him to give up
his business, reduced him to poverty, and plunged
him at first into great dejection. However, that did
not last long, and there was no man in Geneva
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
that had such fits of gaiety. At a banquet, nobody
was louder than P&eacute;colat; he laughed and joked; pun
followed pun, in rapid succession. ‘What happy things
come into his head!’ said everybody, and ‘it was these
happy things,’ adds the chronicler, ‘that gave him
access to good tables.’<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> When he entered the room
a frank and hearty greeting, an enthusiasm mingled
with laughter welcomed his arrival. But P&eacute;colat
had hardly left his friends when dark thoughts
mounted to his brain. Sitting in his narrow chamber,
he thought of his maimed arm, his indigence, his dependent
life; he thought frequently too of the liberties
of Geneva, which he saw sacrificed; and this strange
man who made all the city laugh, would burst into
tears. It was not long before P&eacute;colat compromised
himself in such a manner as to furnish arms against
the patriots of Geneva.</p>

<p>The Bishop of Maurienne, precentor of the cathedral
and canon of Geneva, who had a suit against the bishop,
was then staying in the city and ‘feasting’ the citizens.
Having one day invited several of his friends,
and among others his colleague the Abbot of Bonmont,
who always had a grudge against the bishop for depriving
him of the diocese, he invited P&eacute;colat also.
During the dinner the two prelates worked themselves
into a passion against the bastard of Savoy: each
tried who could attack him the most bitterly, and
indeed he gave them a fair handle. P&eacute;colat began
to do as the others, and to let fly his usual epigrams
against the bastard. Maurienne had no end of
complaints. ‘Pray, my lord,’ said P&eacute;colat, ‘do not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
vex yourself about the bishop’s injustice: <i>non videbit
dies Petri</i>: he will not live as long as St. Peter!’
This was a saying they were in the habit of applying
to the popes at the time of their coronation;
and P&eacute;colat meant to say that the bishop, who, as
everybody knew, was suffering under an incurable
disease, could not live long. Two Savoyards, creatures
of the duke and the bishop, who were of the party,
went immediately and repeated these words to the
bastard. ‘At sumptuous tables,’ said the prior of St.
Victor, who was probably one of the guests, ‘there
are always gluttons picking up words that will get
them another dinner.’ The episcopal court concluded
from the Latin proverb that the independents were
conspiring against the bishop, and that P&eacute;colat announced
the prelate’s death as near at hand. This
speech was not sufficient, however, to send him to
trial: they waited for some act that would serve as a
pretence for the charge of assassination.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a></p>

<p>The opportunity soon occurred. Not long after,
the duke having crossed the mountains to present his
homage to Queen Claude of Brittany, whom Francis I.
had just married, and who was then at Lyons, invited
the bishop to come and see him in this city. The bastard
set off immediately: his steward ordered some fish
pasties as provision for the journey, and the purveyor,
whether from hurry or from desire to make a large
profit, used fish that had been kept too long. The
bishop did not touch them, but some of his people
having eaten of them, fell sick; it was asserted that
one of them died. The bastard, whose conscience
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
was none of the easiest, saw an assassin everywhere;
and though in this matter of the pasties there was
nothing but what was very natural, he thought or
seemed to think that it was an attempt at poisoning.
The idea occurred to certain Savoyards that they
might make use of this story to accuse P&eacute;colat, and
show the cardinals that the prince-bishop’s subjects
were conspiring against him.</p>

<p>P&eacute;colat had so little to do with my lord’s kitchen
that at first the vidame refused to prosecute; but the
affair of Messire Gros’ mule having occurred, and
greatly annoyed the judges, they hesitated no longer.
P&eacute;colat was one of the band who had cried ‘The
skin of the gross beast!’ On the 27th of July, 1517,
a warrant was issued against him.</p>

<p>It was necessary to arrest P&eacute;colat; but that was no
easy thing, for the members of the society <i>Who touches
one touches all</i>, would no doubt rise and defend him.
It was resolved to arrange the matter carefully.
First they would get the most determined of the
young men out of Geneva; then they would entice
P&eacute;colat into some lonely place; and finally, as they
knew not what might happen, the bishop should go
and stay in some castle beyond the reach of the Genevese.
This triple stratagem was immediately put
into execution. The Count of Genevois, who played
the part of a jovial host, organised a grand hunt of
wild animals, the rendezvous being at Vouache, two
leagues to the west of Geneva; he invited the Abbot
of Bonmont, Bonivard, and many young men of the
city, whose names were in the <i>black book</i>, that is,
whom they wished to get rid of. While this joyous
company was hunting with hound and horn at the foot
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
of Mont Saleve, the bishop wishing to enjoy a fresher
air (it was said) had repaired, escorted by a few
gentlemen, to his castle of Thiez between the mountains
of Mole, Voirons, and Reposoir, on the road to
Mont Blanc, a little above the point where the Giffre
torrent joins the Arve. At the same time one
Maule, a secret agent of the vidame, invited P&eacute;colat
to take a walk with him to Pressinge, a village situated
between the lake and the Voirons, where one of
them possessed some property. Ten horsemen setting
out from the castle of Thiez lay in ambush. They
surrounded the two pedestrians, bound and carried
them to the castle, where the bishop having released the
tempter, threw P&eacute;colat into prison. When the news
of this treachery reached Geneva, the irritation was
directed against Maule still more than against the
bishop. The traitor, who seems to have been a man
of debauched life, was loaded with the people’s maledictions.
‘May the cancer eat Maule up!’ they cried;
and this saying became a proverb applicable to traitors
ever afterwards.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a></p>

<p>He had however played his part so well that the
imprisoned P&eacute;colat was exasperated not against him
but against his most intimate friend Berthelier. His
black fit came over him. He said to himself that
although a man of the most inoffensive character, he
seemed destined to expiate the faults of all his party.
With what had they to reproach him? Mere jokes
and laughter.... Berthelier was the real conspirator,
and he was at large.... On the 3rd of April
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
P&eacute;colat was removed from the dungeon into which he
had been thrown, and conducted to the top of the
castle, under the roof. The bishop had ordered him
‘to be examined and forced to speak the truth;’ and
the torture-room was at the top of the castle. After the
usual preliminaries the examination began. The plot
of the <i>non videbit</i> and the salt fish was too absurd;
M. de Thoire, the examining judge, dwelt but little
upon it, and endeavoured particularly (for that was
the object of the arrest) to obtain such admissions
as would ruin Geneva and her principal citizens. As
P&eacute;colat deposed to nothing that would inculpate
them, he was tied by one hand to the rope, and, as
he still refused to answer, was hoisted four feet
from the floor. The poor fellow groaned deeply
and speaking with difficulty<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> said: ‘Cursed be Berthelier
for whom I am shut up!’ He made no confession,
however.</p>

<p>The next day they resorted to another expedient.
The bishop gave himself the pleasure of keeping the
wretched man hanging to the cord while he was at dinner.
The servants, as they passed backwards and forwards
waiting on their master, said to P&eacute;colat: ‘You
are very stupid to let yourself be put to such torture:
confess everything. What will your silence help you?
Maule has told everything; he has named So-and-so
... the Abbot of Bonmont, for instance, whom
you want to make your bishop after you have done
for my lord.’ All these traps were useless&mdash;he made
no confession. It was next determined to expose
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
P&eacute;colat to a more cruel torture: the executioners tied
his hands behind his back, and then pulled the rope
so as to raise his arms above his head; lastly they lifted
him five or six feet from the floor, which was enough to
dislocate his shoulders. P&eacute;colat suffered horribly, and
he was not a Regulus. ‘Let me down! let me down!’
he cried, ‘and I will tell all.’ ... The judges, delighted
at having vanquished the obstinate rebel at last, ordered
him to be lowered. Terror was in his heart,
and his features betrayed the trouble of his mind.
The man, usually so gay and so witty, was now pale,
affrighted, his eyes wandered, and he fancied himself
surrounded by hungry dogs. He said all that they
wanted him to say. To the falsest imputations against
the noblest of his friends he answered ‘Yes, yes!’ and
the satisfied judges sent him back to his dungeon.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a></p>

<p>This was no comfort to the unhappy P&eacute;colat: more
terrible anguish awaited him there. The thought
that he had deposed against his best friends and even
incurred the guilt of bearing false witness, alarmed
him seriously: the fear of God’s judgment surpassed
all the terrors which men had caused him.
‘Gentlemen,’ said he to the noble F. de Thoire and
others standing round him, ‘my declarations were
extorted from me only by the fear of torture. If I
had died at that moment, I should have been eternally
damned for my lies.’<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a></p>

<p>The bastard, not liking to feel himself within the
same walls as his victim, had removed to St. Joire,
two leagues from Thiez, and there attentively watched
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
the examination and the torture. He had acquired a
taste for it; and accordingly on the 5th of August he
ordered another prisoner to be put to the question.
‘I have some here who say plenty of good things,’
he wrote to Geneva.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> These ‘good things’ were the
false witness extorted by pain and which permitted
the imprisonment of the innocent. The terror increased
in Geneva every day. People kept themselves
indoors, the streets were deserted: a few
labourers only could be seen in the fields. Bonivard,
who feared, and not without cause, that the bishop
and the duke wished to carry him off also, did not
leave St. Victor’s. ‘Things are in such a state,’
he said, ‘that no one dares venture into the country
lest he should be treated like P&eacute;colat.’ Many of
the citizens quitted Geneva. One day two friends
happened to meet in a room of the hostelry of St.
Germain on the Jura. ‘Where are you going?’ asked
one of them who had just come from Lyons. ‘I
am leaving Geneva,’ answered the other, by name
Du Bouchet. ‘They have so tortured P&eacute;colat that
his arms remained hanging to the rope, and he died
upon the rack.’ Du Bouchet added: ‘The Church
not having the right of putting men to death, my lord
of Geneva will have to send somebody to Rome to
get him absolved. He weeps greatly about it, they
say; but I place no trust in such crocodile’s tears!...
I am going to Lyons.’<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a></p>

<p>The bishop had no notion of excusing himself to
the pope: on the contrary, he thought only of pursuing
his revenge. The <i>decoy</i> was in the cage and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
some small birds with him; he wished now at any
cost to catch the large one,&mdash;Berthelier. Most of the
youth of Geneva were either out of the way or disheartened;
the league <i>Who touches one touches all</i> was
nearly dissolved, at the moment when it ought to have
been ready to save its founder. The bishop thought
it superfluous to resort to stratagem or violence and
simply required the syndics to surrender the great
agitator to him. At eight o’clock in the evening of
the 28th of July, 1517, the council was sitting,
when the president who was on the bishop’s side
said: ‘It is my lord’s pleasure that we take up one
of his subjects against whom he possesses sufficient
informations which he will communicate in proper
time and place; and that when the said subject is in
prison, the syndics shall execute justice, if the affair
requires it.’<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> At these words every one looked at a
seat which was empty for the first time. Berthelier’s
friends were uneasy; and as the bishop had adopted a
lawful course, the council answered the prelate that
they would take up the accused, provided that on
his part he maintained the liberties of Geneva.</p>

<p>As the councillors left the H&ocirc;tel de Ville in the
dark, they said to one another: ‘It is Berthelier.’ The
friends he had among them ran off to tell him the
news, conjuring him to escape the vengeance of the
prince by flight. Bonivard joined his entreaties to
theirs: ‘The sword is over your head,’ he said.&mdash;‘I
know it,’ answered Berthelier, ‘yes, I know that
I shall die, and I do not grieve at it.’ ‘Really,’ said
Bonivard, ‘I never saw and never read of one who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
held life so cheap.’ The friends of the noble-minded
citizen redoubled their entreaties. They
represented to him that there remained in Geneva
only a small number of civic guards, imperfectly
trained to arms;<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> that one part of the burgesses
would assent through fear to the plots of the
Savoyard party, and that another part would aid
them. Berthelier still resisted: ‘God,’ said he,
‘will miraculously take away their power.’<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> His
friends resorted to another argument. There happened
to be just then in Geneva some envoys from
Friburg; Berthelier’s friends begged him to depart
with them. ‘Out of Geneva,’ they said, ‘you will
serve the city better than within.’ That consideration
decided him. He went during the night to the
hostelry of the Friburgers. ‘We leave to-morrow,’
they told him; ‘here is a livery cloak with the arms
of Friburg; put it on, and thus disguised you shall
come with us, like one of the state riders. If you
are not recognised at the gates of Geneva or in the
Pays de Vaud, you are safe.’ The Friburgers left
the city very early: the guard looked at them for a
moment as they passed the gate, but without suspecting
that the great republican was with them.
He was safe.</p>

<p>The next day the syndic Nergaz having delivered
the message of the council to the bastard of Savoy,
the latter was exasperated because instead of seizing
Berthelier, they simply told him that they intended
doing so. ‘Do you mean to give him time to escape?’
he asked. The council immediately ordered a great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
display of force to arrest the liberal leader. His
friends the councillors, who knew him to be already far
away in the country, let his enemies go on. ‘Shut all
the city gates,’ said they. ‘Assemble the tithing men
and the tens; summon the vidame to assist in executing
the law; let the syndics preside in person
over the search for the culprit.’<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> ‘Bravo!’ whispered
some aside, ‘shut the cage ... the bird
has flown.’ The most zealous of the bishop’s partisans
hurried off to close the gates. The syndics
and tithing men set out, followed by a great number
of citizens, and all went towards Berthelier’s
house. They searched every chamber, they sounded
every hiding-place, but found nobody. Some were
angry, others laughed in their sleeves; the most
violent, supposing he had escaped to one of his
friends, put themselves at the head of the troop and
searched every house that Berthelier was in the habit
of frequenting. As a six days’ search led to nothing,
they were forced to rest satisfied with summoning
the accused by sound of the trumpet. No one had
any more doubts about his escape: the liberals were
delighted, but anger and vexation prevailed at the
castle.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.<br />

<span class="small">BERTHELIER CALLS THE SWISS TO THE AID OF GENEVA; HUGUENOTS
AND MAMELUKES; THE BISHOP’S VIOLENCE.</span></h2>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Berthelier’s</span> flight was more than a flight.
He went to Switzerland; and from that day
Switzerland turned towards Geneva, and held out the
hand to her.</p>

<p>Disguised in the livery of an usher of the city
of Friburg, the faithful citizen arrived there without
hindrance. No one there felt more affection
for Geneva than Councillor Marty, governor of the
hospital, who by his energy, rank, and intelligence,
possessed great influence in the city. Berthelier
went to his house, sat down at his hearth, and
remained for some time sorrowful, silent, and motionless.
It was thus that an illustrious Roman had
formerly sat with veiled head at the hearth of a
stranger; but Coriolanus sought among the Volsci the
means of destroying his country, Berthelier sought at
Friburg the means of saving his. A great idea, which
had long since quickened in the hearts of himself and
some other patriots, had occupied his mind while he
was riding through the Vaudois territory. Times
had changed. The long conspiracy of Savoy against
Geneva was on the point of succeeding. The obstinate
duke, the dishonoured bishop, the crafty count&mdash;all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
united their forces to destroy the independence of
the city. Switzerland alone, after God, could save
it from the hands of the Savoyards. Geneva must
become a canton, or at least an ally of Switzerland.
‘For that,’ said Berthelier, ‘I would give my head.’
He began to discourse familiarly with his host. He
told him that he had arrived in Friburg, poor,
exiled, persecuted, and a suppliant; not to save his
life, but to save Geneva; that he had come to pray
Friburg to receive the Genevans into citizenship.
At the same time he described with eloquence the
calamities of his country. Marty greatly moved
held out his hand, told him to take courage and
to follow him into the ‘abbeys’ where the guilds
assembled. ‘If you gain them,’ he said, ‘your cause
is won.’</p>

<p>The Genevan and the Friburger immediately set
off together to the chief of these ‘abbeys’ or clubs.
They had scarcely entered the hall, when Marty in
some confusion whispered into his companion’s ear:
‘Some of the duke’s pensioners are here; veil your
meaning, for fear they should stop our work.’ Berthelier
took the hint, and, rendered cautious by the
presence of his enemies, spoke in ambiguous language,
concealing his thoughts, but in such a manner
that they might be guessed. He spoke of the wars
that Burgundy had waged against Switzerland and of
Charles the Bold; he intended thus to remind them
of the war Savoy was now making upon Geneva and of
Charles <i>the Good</i>. He hinted that the Swiss ought
to distrust the Duke of Savoy, however smiling the
face he showed them. Had they not spoiled his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
country during the Burgundian wars, and did they
not still occupy a part of it? ‘Your ancestors,’ said
Berthelier, ‘have plundered and ravaged certain provinces&mdash;you
know which&mdash;and in any case <i>others</i>
do not forget it.... If <i>somebody</i> should become master
of Geneva, he would fortify it against you ...
but if Geneva became your ally, you could make
it your rampart against all princes and potentates.’
Every one knew of whom Berthelier was speaking.
But if he saw the angry eye of some pensioner
of Savoy fixed upon him, he became more
guarded, his language more figurative and interrupted;
he spoke lower, and ‘as if at random,’ said
Bonivard. Then remembering Geneva, his courage
revived, and his energetic accents burst forth again
in the council of Friburg. He then forgot all prudence,
and made, says the chronicler, a great <i>lament</i>
of the oppression under which the city groaned.
This speech, which aroused violent storms, was not
to remain useless: Berthelier’s eloquent words were
fruitful thoughts, cast into the hearts of the people
of Friburg. Like those seeds which, borne by the
tempest, fall here and there among the Alps, they
were destined one day to revive in Geneva the
ancient tree of her liberties.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a></p>

<p>The exile desired that the Friburgers should see
the misfortunes of Geneva with their own eyes, and
connect themselves with the principal men there.
If Geneva and Friburg come together, he thought,
the flame will break out and the union will
be cemented. He attained his end. Some citizens
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
of Friburg set off, arrived at Geneva, and were welcomed
by Besan&ccedil;on Hugues, Vandel, and all the
patriots. They dined sometimes with one, sometimes
with the other. They spoke of the liberties of the
Swiss; they described their heroic struggles, and in
these animated conversations, hearts were melted and
united in such a way as to form but one. The deputies,
having been received by the council, complained
of the violation of the franchises of the city, and
demanded a safe-conduct for Berthelier. Three councillors
immediately set off for St. Joire, a village in
the mountains, a few leagues from Geneva, where the
bastard happened to be staying at a castle he possessed
there. John did not like to be disturbed in his country
retreats; he gave orders, however, that the magistrates
should be admitted, when they set before him pretty
plainly the complaints of the Friburgers. ‘What!
<i>I</i> violate the franchises!’ he exclaimed, with a look of
astonishment, ‘I had never even thought of it. A
safe-conduct for Berthelier ... why, he does not
require one. If he believes himself innocent, let
him come; I am a good prince.... No, no, no! No
safe-conduct!’ On the 12th of August the syndics
communicated this answer to the Friburgers. The
Swiss were indignant, and as if the syndics had some
share in the matter, they upbraided them: ‘Why even
the Turks would not refuse a safe-conduct, and yet a
bishop dares do it! A safe-conduct useless?... Was
not P&eacute;colat seized a few days ago beyond the bounds of
the city? Did they not expose him to such torture that
pain extorted from him all they wanted? Citizens
have left the town in alarm; others are shut up in their
houses. Are they not always bringing one or another
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
into trouble? And yet the bishop refuses Berthelier a
safe-conduct?... Very well! we will get together all
these grievances and see them remedied. Rest assured
of this ... we will risk our persons and our goods.
We will come in such force that we will take his Highness’s
governor in the Pays de Vaud, the friends of
Savoy in your city, and then&mdash;we will treat them as you
have treated our friends.’&mdash;Upon this they departed
in great anger, say contemporary manuscripts.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a></p>

<p>The language of the Friburgers, repeated from
house to house, inflamed all hearts. The union
between Geneva and Switzerland was, so to speak,
accomplished before any public act had rendered it
official and authentic. Berthelier had foreseen that
Geneva would find in the Helvetic league a mightier
protection than in that of the young men enrolled
beneath the flag of dissipation.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> From that moment
a political party was slowly formed, a party calm but
firm, which put itself at the head of the movement
and replaced the licentious band of the ‘children of
Geneva.’</p>

<p>The Friburg deputies had hardly left the city,
when the duke’s party accosting the independent
Genevans, and gallicising each in his own way the
German word <i>Eidesgenossen</i> (confederates) which they
could not pronounce, called after them <i>Eidguenots</i>,
<i>Eignots</i>, <i>Eyguenots</i>, <i>Huguenots</i>! This word is met
with in the chronicles of the time written in different
ways;<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> Michel Roset, the most respectable of these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
authorities of the sixteenth century, writes <i>Huguenots</i>;
we adopt that form, because it is the only one that has
passed into our language. It is possible that the
name of the citizen, Besan&ccedil;on Hugues, who became
the principal leader of this party, may have contributed
to the preference of this form over all the others. In
any case it must be remembered that until after the
Reformation this sobriquet had a purely political meaning,
in no respect religious, and designated simply
the friends of independence. Many years after, the
enemies of the protestants of France called them by this
name, wishing to stigmatise them, and impute to them a
foreign, republican, and heretical origin. Such is the
true etymology of the word; it would be very strange
if these two denominations, which are really but one,
had played so great a part in the sixteenth century, at
Geneva and in French protestantism, without having
had any connection with one another. A little later,
about Christmas, 1518, when the cause of the alliance
was more advanced, its use became more general. The
adherents of the duke had no sooner started the nickname
than their opponents, repaying them in their own
coin, called out: ‘Hold your tongues, you Mamelukes!... As
the Mamelukes have denied Christ to follow
Mahomet, so you deny liberty and the public cause
to put yourselves under a tyranny.’<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> At the head
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
of these Mamelukes were some forty rich tradesmen,
men good enough at heart despite their nickname, but
they were men of business who feared that disturbances
would diminish their gains. The term Mamelukes
put them into a great passion: ‘Yes,’ continued
the Huguenots, ‘Sultan Selim conquered the Mamelukes
last year in Egypt; but it seems that these
slaves, when expelled from Cairo, took refuge at
Geneva. However, if you do not like the name ...
stay, since you deliver up Geneva through avarice,
we will call you Judases!’<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a></p>

<p>While the city was thus disturbed, the bishop,
proud of having tortured the wretched P&eacute;colat, removed
from St. Joire to Thonon. He had never
experienced to a like degree the pleasure of making
his power felt, and was delighted at it; for though
servile before the duke, he had in him some of the
characteristics of the tyrant. He had made somebody
tremble! ... and he therefore regarded the trap
laid for P&eacute;colat as a glorious deed, and desired to
enjoy his triumph in the capital of Chablais. At the
same time he repeated to every one who would listen
to him that he would not return to Geneva: ‘They
would murder me,’ he said. The Genevans, conscientiously
submissive to the established order, resolved
to display their loyalty in a marked manner.
There lived at that time in Geneva an old man, Pierre
d’Orsi&egrave;res, respected by all parties, whose family possessed
the lordship of that name in Valais, on the way
to the St. Bernard pass. Forty years before (in 1477)
he had been one of the hostages given to the Swiss;
since then he had been six times elected chief magistrate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
of the State. His son Hugonin had been made
a canon out of respect to his father; but he was a
fanatical priest and in after days the most hostile of all
the clergy to the Reformation. The council resolved
to send a solemn deputation to the bishop, and placed
the syndic D’Orsi&egrave;res at its head.</p>

<p>It was perhaps carrying rather far their desire to
appear loyal subjects, and these good people of Geneva
were to learn what it costs to flatter a tyrant. The
bastard determined to gain fresh triumphs. Tormented
by disease he needed diversion; the sufferings of his
enemies made him feel a certain pleasure&mdash;it was
sympathy after his fashion. He bore a mortal hatred
against all the Genevans, even against the most
catholic: an opportunity of gratifying it offered itself.
The deputation having appeared before him and
made every demonstration of respect, he fixed his
bloodshot eyes upon the noble old man, whose hoary
head bent humbly before him, and ordered him to be
seized, to be taken out of his sight and thrown into a
dungeon. If he had been proud of his exploits
against P&eacute;colat the hosier, he was more so now at
having by one bold stroke put out of the way a man
whose family shone in the first rank, and whom his
fellow-citizens had invested with the sacred character
of ambassador. When the news of this outrage
reached Geneva, all the city (Huguenot and Mameluke)
cried out. The man most respected in the
whole State had been seized as a criminal at the very
moment when he was giving the bishop proofs
of the most loyal fidelity. They doubted not
that this crime would be the signal of an attack
upon the city; the citizens immediately ran to arms,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
stretched the chains across the streets, and shut
the gates.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a></p>

<p>The duke was displeased at these mistakes of the
bishop, and they came upon him at a difficult moment.
Charles III., a weak and fickle prince, inclined at that
time to the emperor’s side, and displeased his nephew
Francis I., who seemed disposed to give him a roughish
lesson. Moreover, the proceedings of the Friburgers
disquieted him, for Geneva was lost to Savoy
if the Swiss took up its cause. Liberty, hitherto
driven back to the German Alps, would plant her
standard in that city of the Leman, and raise a
platform whence she would act upon all the populations
speaking the French tongue. The most skilful
politicians of Savoy&mdash;Seyssel who had just been
appointed archbishop of Turin, and Eustace Chappuis
who understood thoroughly the mutual relations of
states, and whom Charles V. employed afterwards in
his negotiations with Henry VIII.&mdash;represented to
the duke that he must take care at any cost not to
alienate the Swiss. The terrified Charles III. assented
to everything, and Chappuis was authorised to patch
up the blunders committed by the bishop.</p>

<p>This learned diplomatist saw clearly that the great
business was, if possible, to raise an insurmountable
barrier between the Swiss and the Genevans. He
reflected on the means of effecting it: and resolving
to show himself kind and good-natured, he set out for
Geneva. By the duke’s intervention he had been made
official of the episcopal court; as such he was sworn
in before the syndics; he then exerted all his skill to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
alienate the Genevans from the Swiss and attach them
to the house of Savoy; but his fine words did not
convert many. ‘The duke,’ said the prior of St.
Victor, ‘seeing that his cats have caught no rats,
sends us the sleekest of mousers.’ Chappuis immediately
set off for Friburg, where he began to <i>practise</i>
on the pensioners. ‘Ha!’ said they, ‘Berthelier
is an instance of what the princes of Savoy can
do.’ The diplomatist stuck at nothing: he called
upon the fugitive and entreated him to return to
Geneva, promising him a pardon.&mdash;‘A pardon!’
exclaimed the haughty citizen, ‘pardon does not
concern good men but criminals. I demand absolution
if I am innocent, and punishment if I
am guilty.’<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a></p>

<p>Berthelier’s firmness paralysed all the diplomatist’s
efforts; and it was decided that the duke himself
should visit Switzerland. Making a pretence of business
at Geneva and Lausanne, Charles III. arrived
at Friburg and Berne. He endeavoured to win
over the cantons, induced them to dissuade the king
of France from making war upon him, renewed his
alliance with the League, and as they complained
of the tyranny of his cousin the bishop, of the illegal
arrest of P&eacute;colat, and of Berthelier’s exile, he made
them all the fairest promises.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a></p>

<p>But he reckoned without his host: the bishop who
had a meaner character than the duke, had also a
more obstinate temper. As his illustrious cousin had
visited Switzerland, it was his duty to be there to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
receive him; he had accordingly returned to Geneva,
and as some sensible men had made him understand
how deeply he was compromised in D’Orsi&egrave;res’ arrest,
he set the good old man at liberty. If he consented
to yield on this point, he was determined not
to give way on others. When the syndics complained
to him of the irregularities committed within the city
and without, representing to him that citizens were
arrested without cause, and that too, not by the officers
of justice, but&mdash;a thing unprecedented&mdash;by his own
archers, the prelate was deaf; he turned away his
head, looked at what was going on around him, and
dismissed the magistrates as politely as he could.
Accordingly when the duke returned from Friburg,
the syndics laid all their grievances before him: ‘Our
franchises are infringed by the bishop. A citizen
cannot be arrested beyond our boundaries, yet P&eacute;colat
was seized at Pressinge. All criminal cases fall
within the syndics’ jurisdiction, yet P&eacute;colat has
been tried by the episcopal officers.’ Whereupon the
bishop and the duke, wishing to have the appearance
of giving some little satisfaction to the Swiss and
the Genevans, transferred P&eacute;colat from his prison at
Thiez to Geneva, and shut him up in the Ch&acirc;teau de
l’Ile. But neither the duke nor the bishop dreamt of
letting him go; would they ever have a better opportunity
of showing the cardinals that the bishop’s life
was in danger? But if P&eacute;colat should appear before
the syndics, his judges, would he be condemned?
The duke’s friends shook their heads. ‘One of them,
the elder L&eacute;vrier, an incorrigible dotard,’ they said,
‘would sooner be put in prison, as in 1506, than give
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
way; another, Richardet, a hot-headed fellow, would
wax wroth, and perhaps draw his sword; and Porral,
a wag like his elder brother, would turn his back and
laugh at the Mamelukes!’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.<br />

<span class="small">FRESH TORTURES, P&Eacute;COLAT’S DESPAIR AND STRIKING
DELIVERANCE.</span></h2>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">P&eacute;colat’s</span> condemnation became the chief business
of the court of Turin in its relations with
Geneva. Archbishop Seyssel, who at that time possessed
great influence, was not for despotism: he
approved of moderating the royal authority, but hated
republics, and wished to take advantage of P&eacute;colat’s
trial to crush the spirit of liberty, which was displaying
so much energy in Geneva, and which might
spread farther. Feeling the importance of this case,
in combating the Huguenot influence, the archbishop
determined to withdraw, if possible, the Genevan
from his natural judges, and resorted to a trick unworthy
so great a statesman. He represented that
high treason, the crime of which P&eacute;colat was accused,
was not one of those comprehended under the constitutions
of the city, and that the cognisance belonged
therefore to the prince; but he could not succeed.
‘We have the power,’ answered the syndics, ‘to take
cognisance of every criminal case.’ All that Seyssel
could obtain was that the bishop should appoint delegates
who would sit in court and give their opinion,
but not vote.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span></p>

<p>The judges met in the Ch&acirc;teau de l’Ile on the
10th of December, 1517; they were surrounded by
the duke’s and the bishop’s attorneys, the governor of
Vaud, and other partisans of Savoy. Among the six
councillors who were to sit with the syndics (the
judges being thus ten in number), were some decided
ducal partisans, upon whom the bishop could rely for
a sentence of condemnation. Poor P&eacute;colat, still suffering,
was brought in by the vidame. The sight of the
syndics&mdash;of the elder L&eacute;vrier, Richardet, and Porral&mdash;revived
his courage: he knew that they were just
men and enemies of episcopal despotism. ‘The confessions
I made at Thiez,’ he said, ‘were wrung from me
by torture: the judge dictated the words and I repeated
them after him. I knew that if I did not say what
they wanted, they would break my arms, and maim
me for ever.’<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a></p>

<p>After this declaration, the examination began: the
clearness of P&eacute;colat’s answers, his gentleness and
candour, showed all present that they had before them
an innocent man, whom powerful princes desired to
destroy. The syndics having declared that they were
bound to acquit him, the bishop said: ‘Give him the
question, and you will see clearly that he is guilty.’
The syndics refused, whereupon the two princes
accused them of being partial and suspected men.
The episcopal council, therefore, decided, that the city
and the bishop should each appoint four judges&mdash;an
illegal measure, to which the syndics submitted.</p>

<p>The new examination ought to have taken place on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
the 20th of January, 1518; but P&eacute;colat, suffering
from the torture past and terrified by the torture to
come, had fallen seriously ill, and it was necessary
to send the doctor to him. This man consented to
his being carried before the court. The four episcopal
judges immediately called for the question, but the
syndics opposed it, and the episcopal delegates began
to study this living corpse. After examining him
attentively they said: ‘He still affords some hold for
the torture; he may be examined with <i>a few torments</i>’
(such is the expression in the report). Nergaz siding
with the Savoyard doctors, the torture was decided
upon. Poor P&eacute;colat began to tremble from head to
foot; he knew that he should denounce all his friends,
and cursed his own weakness. They tied his hands
behind his back, they showed him the rack, and interrogated
him.... ‘However, they did not torture him,’
continues the report, ‘considering the weakness of
his body and his long imprisonment.’ They thought
that the fear of the rack would suffice to make him
speak; they were deceived; the sick&mdash;we might
almost call him the dying man, though tied up and
bound, having the instrument of torture before
him, answered with simplicity and frankness. Even
the bishop’s judges were struck with his candour,
and two of them, ‘having the fear of God before their
eyes,’ says Bonivard, rather than the fear of men,
declared <i>roundly</i>: ‘They have done this poor man
wrong. <i>Non invenimus in eo causam.</i> We find no
fault in him.’<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span></p>

<p>This honourable declaration embarrassed the duke
all the more that he had other anxieties on his mind.
The news from Piedmont was bad: every day he received
letters urging him to return. ‘The Marquis of
Montferrat.’ they told him, ‘is committing serious depredations.’
But the headstrong prince was ready to
lose his own states, if he could but get Geneva&mdash;and
lose them he did not long after. Finding himself on the
point of discovering a conspiracy, calculated to satisfy
the cardinals, he resolved not to yield. His creatures
and those of the prelate held conference after conference;
at last they found a means&mdash;a diabolical
means&mdash;of putting P&eacute;colat to death. Seeing that
lay judges were not to be persuaded to condemn an
innocent man, they resolved that he should be tried
by priests. To put this plan into execution, it was
necessary to change the layman&mdash;the ex-hosier, the
merry fellow who was at every banquet and every
masquerade&mdash;into a churchman. They succeeded.
‘To gratify their appetite,’ said Bonivard, ‘they produced
a forged letter, to the effect that P&eacute;colat was
an <i>ordained clerk</i> ... and therefore his case belonged
not to the secular, but to the ecclesiastical judge.’
The fraud found, or seemed to find belief in the
official world. ‘Accordingly,’ goes on the chronicle,
‘they transferred him from the Ch&acirc;teau de l’Ile,
which was the lay prison, to the bishop’s palace
which was the Church court, and he was placed once
more in the hands of the Pharisees.’ This was a
stroke worthy of a celebrated religious order not yet in
existence, but which was about to be founded to combat
the Reformation. Henceforth we shall see none
of that silly consideration, of that delicate circumspection,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
which the laymen had employed. The
bishop, now become judge and party, ‘deliberated
how to handle him well.’ Some persons having
asserted that P&eacute;colat could not endure the rack,
the doctors again examined his poor body: some
said yes and others no, so the judges decided that
the first were right, and the instrument of torture
was prepared. It was not only heroic men like
the Bertheliers and L&eacute;vriers, who, by their daring
opposition to arbitrary power, were then raising the
edifice of liberty; but it was also these wicked
judges, these tyrannical princes, these cruel executioners,
who by their wheel and rack were preparing
the new and more equitable times of modern
society.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a></p>

<p>When P&eacute;colat was informed of the fatal decision,
his terrors recommenced. The prospect of a new
torture, the thought of the accusations he would
make against his friends, disturbed his conscience
and plunged him into despair.... His features were
distorted by it, his beard was in disorder, his eyes
were haggard: all in him expressed suffering and
terror. His keepers, not understanding this state
of his mind, thought that he was possessed by a
devil. ‘Berthelier,’ said they, ‘is a great <i>charmer</i>,
he has a familiar spirit. He has charmed P&eacute;colat
to render him insensible to the torture; try as we
may, he will say nothing.’ It was the belief at that
time that the <i>charmers</i> lodged certain devils in the
patients’ hair. The prisoner’s long rough beard
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
disquieted the bishop’s officers. It was resolved
that P&eacute;colat should be shaved in order to expel the
demon.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a></p>

<p>According to rule it should have been an exorcist
and not a barber that they should have sent
for. Robed in surplice and stole, the priest should
have made the sign of the cross over P&eacute;colat,
sprinkled him with holy water, and pronounced loud-sounding
anathemas against the evil spirit. But no,
the bishop was contented to send a barber, which was
much more prosaic; it may be that, besides all his
other vices, the bastard was a freethinker. The
barber came and got his razor ready. The devil
whom P&eacute;colat feared, was his own cowardice. ‘I
shall inculpate my best friends,’ he said to himself;
‘I shall confess that Berthelier wished to kill the
bishop; I shall say all they want me to say....
And then if I die on the rack (which was very
possible, considering the exhaustion of his strength)
I shall be eternally damned for having lied in the
hour of death.’ This idea alarmed him; a tempest
agitated his soul; he was already in agony. ‘It is
better,’ he thought, ‘to cut off an arm, a foot, or even
the tongue, than fall into everlasting perdition.’ At
this moment the barber, who had wetted the beard,
quitted the room to throw the water out of the basin;
P&eacute;colat caught up the razor which the man had left
on the table by his side and raised it to his tongue;
but moral and physical force both failing him, he
made only a gash. He was trying again, when the
barber returned, sprang upon him in affright, snatched
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
the razor from his hand, and raised an alarm. The
gaoler, his family, and the prince’s surgeon rushed in
and found P&eacute;colat ‘coughing and spitting out blood
in large quantities.’ They seized him and began to
stanch the blood, which it was not difficult to do. His
tongue was not cut off, as some have asserted; there
was only a deep wound. The officers of the duke
and the bishop took extraordinary pains to cure him,
‘not to do him good,’ say the chronicles, ‘but to do
him a greater ill another time, and that he might use
his tongue in singing whatever they pleased.’ All
were greatly astounded at this mystery, of which there
was great talk throughout the city.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> P&eacute;colat’s wound
having been dressed, the bastard demanded that he
should be put to the rack, but L&eacute;vrier, feeling convinced
that P&eacute;colat was the innocent victim of an illegal
proceeding, opposed it. The bishop still persisted in
the necessity of obtaining a confession from him:
‘Confession!’ replied the judge, ‘he cannot speak.’&mdash;‘Well
then,’ answered, not the executioner but, the
bishop, ‘let him <i>write</i> his answer.’ L&eacute;vrier, as firm
when it was necessary to maintain the respect due to
humanity as the obedience due to the law, declared
that such cruelty should not be practised before his
tribunal. The bishop was forced to give way, but he
kept account of this new offence on the part of the
contumacious judge.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span></p>

<p>All Geneva pitied the unhappy man, and asked if
there was no one to deliver him from this den of
thieves? Bonivard, a man who afterwards knew in
his own person the horrors of a prison, never ceased
thinking of the means of saving him. He loved
P&eacute;colat; he had often admired that simple nature of
his, so impulsive, so strong and yet so weak, and
above all his devotion to the cause of the liberties
of the city. He felt that human and divine rights,
the compassion due to the unhappy, his duty towards
Geneva, (‘although I am not a native,’ he said,)&mdash;all
bound him to make an effort. He left his
monastery, called upon Aim&eacute; L&eacute;vrier, and expressed
his desire to save P&eacute;colat. L&eacute;vrier explained to him
that the bishop had forbidden any further steps, and
that the judges could not act without his consent.
‘There is however one means,’ added he. ‘Let P&eacute;colat’s
relations demand justice of me; I shall refuse, alleging
the prince’s good pleasure. Then let them appeal, on
the ground of denial of justice,<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> to the metropolitan
court of Vienne.’ Bonivard, full of imagination, of
invention, of resources, heedless of precedents, and
energetic, immediately resolved to try this course.
The Archbishop of Vienne (he argued) being always
jealous of the Bishop of Geneva, would be delighted
to humble his powerful colleague. ‘I have friends,
relations, and influence in Savoy,’ said he, ‘I will
move heaven and earth, and we will teach the bastard
a pretty lesson.’ He returned to his monastery and
sent for P&eacute;colat’s two brothers. One of them, Stephen,
enjoyed the full confidence of his fellow-citizens, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
was afterwards raised to the highest offices; but the
tyranny of the princes alarmed everybody: ‘Demand
that your brother be brought to trial,’ said Bonivard
to the two brothers.&mdash;‘No,’ they answered, ‘the
risk is too serious.’ ... Bonivard’s eloquence prevailed
at last. Not wishing to leave them time for
reflection, he took them forthwith to L&eacute;vrier; the
petition, answer, and legal appeal were duly made;
and Stephen P&eacute;colat, who by contact with these two
generous souls had become brave, departed for Vienne
in Dauphiny with a warm recommendation from the
prior. The Church of Vienne had enjoyed from ancient
times the title of holy, of <i>maxima sedes Galliarum</i>,
and its metropolitan was primate of all Gaul. This
prelate, delighted with the opportunity of making his
authority felt by a bishop who was then more powerful
than himself, summoned the procurator-fiscal,
the episcopal council, and the bishop of Geneva to
appear before his court of Vienne within a certain
term, to hear judgment. In the meanwhile he forbade
the bishop to proceed against the prisoner under
pain of excommunication. ‘We are in the right road
now,’ said Bonivard to L&eacute;vrier. But who would
serve this daring summons upon the bishop? These
writs of Vienne were held in such slight esteem by
the powerful prelates of Geneva, that it was usual
to cudgel the bearers of them. It might be foreseen
that the bishop and duke would try every means to
nullify the citation, or induce the archbishop to recall
it. In short, this was not an ordinary case. If
P&eacute;colat was declared innocent, if his depositions
against Berthelier were declared false, what would
become of the scheme of Charles III. and Leo X.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
at which the bishop himself so basely connived?
Geneva would remain free.... The difficulties
which started up did not dishearten Bonivard; he
thought that the devices set on foot to enslave the
city were hateful, and that as he wished to live and
die there, he ought to defend it. ‘And then,’ adds a
chronicler, ‘the commander of St. Victor was more
bold than wise.’ Bonivard formed his resolution.
‘Nobody,’ he said, ‘dares bell the cat ... then I
will attempt the deed.’ ... But his position did
not permit him ‘to pass the river alone.’ It was
necessary that the metropolitan citation should be
served on the bishop by an episcopal bailiff. He
began to search for such a man; and recollecting a
certain poor clerk who vegetated in a wretched room
in the city, he sent for him, put two crowns in his
hand, and said: ‘Here is a letter from the metropolitan
that must be delivered to the bishop. The
duke and the prelate set out the day after to-morrow
for Turin; to-morrow morning they will go and hear
mass at St. Pierre; that will be the latest hour.
There will be no time after that. Hand this paper to
my lord.’ The clerk was afraid, though the two crowns
tempted him strongly; Bonivard pressed him: ‘Well,’
said the poor fellow, ‘I will promise to serve the writ,
provided you assist me personally.’ Bonivard agreed
to do so.</p>

<p>The next day the prior and the clerk entered the
cathedral. The princes were present, surrounded
with much pomp: it was high mass, a farewell mass;
nobody was absent. Bonivard in his quality of
canon had a place of honour in the cathedral which
would have brought him near the bishop; but he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
took care not to go there, and kept himself at a distance
behind the clerk in order to watch him; he feared
lest the poor man should get frightened and escape.
The consecration, the elevation, the chanting, all the
sumptuous forms of Roman worship, all the great
people bending before the altar, acted upon the
unlucky bailiff’s imagination. He began to tremble,
and when the mass was ended and the moment for
action arrived, ‘seeing,’ says Bonivard, ‘that the
game was to be played in earnest,’ he lost his
courage, stealthily crept backwards, and prepared to
run away. But Bonivard, who was watching him,
suddenly stepped forward, seized him by the collar,
and placing the other hand upon a dagger, which he
held beneath his robe, whispered in his ear: ‘If you
do not keep your promise, I swear I will kill you.’
The clerk was almost frightened to death, and not
without cause, ‘for,’ adds Bonivard in his plain-spoken
‘Chronicles,’ ‘I should have done it, which I
do not say to my praise; I know now that I acted
foolishly. But youth and affection carried me away.’
He did not kill the clerk, however; he was satisfied
with holding him tightly by the thumb, and with a
firm hand held him by his side. The poor terrified
man wished in vain to fly: Bonivard’s dagger kept
him motionless; he was like a marble statue.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the duke, his brother the count, and the
bishop were leaving the church, attended by their
magnificent retinue, and returning to the episcopal
palace, where there was to be a grand reception.
‘Now,’ said Bonivard to the clerk, ‘no more delay,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
you must discharge your commission;’ then he put
the metropolitan citation into the hand that was free,
and still holding him by the thumb, led him thus to
the palace.</p>

<p>When he came near the bishop, the energetic prior
letting go the thumb, which he had held as if in a
vice, and pointing to the prelate, said to the clerk:
‘Do your duty.’ The bishop hearing these words,
‘was much afraid,’ says Bonivard, ‘and turned pale,
thinking I was ordering him to be killed.’ The
cowardly prelate turning with alarm towards the
supposed assassin cast a look of distress upon those
around him. The clerk trembled as much as he;
but meeting the terrible eye of the prior and seeing
the dagger under his robes, he fell on his knees before
the bishop, and kissing the writ, presented it to him,
saying: ‘My lord, <i>inhibitur vobis, prout in copia</i>.’<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a>
He then put the document into his hand and ran off:
‘Upon this,’ adds the prior, ‘I retired to my priory
of St. Victor. I felt such juvenile and silly arrogance,
that I feared neither bishop nor duke.’
Bonivard had his culverins no longer, but he would
yet have stood a siege if necessary to bring this
matter to a successful issue. The bishop never
forgot the fright Bonivard had caused him, and swore
to be even with him.</p>

<p>This energetic action gave courage to others.
Fourscore citizens more or less implicated with
P&eacute;colat in the affair of the rotten fish&mdash;‘all honest
people’&mdash;appeared before the princes, and demanded
that if they and P&eacute;colat were guilty, they should be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
punished; but if they were innocent that it should be
publicly acknowledged. The princes, whose situation
was growing difficult, were by no means eager to
have eighty cases in hand instead of one. ‘We are
sure,’ they answered, ‘that this poisoning is a thing
invented by certain wicked men, and we look upon
all of you as honest people. But as for P&eacute;colat, he
was always a naughty fellow; for which reason we
wish to keep him a short time in prison to correct
him.’ Then fearing lest he should be liberated by
force during their absence, the princes of Savoy had
him transferred to the castle of Peney, which was
contrary to the franchises of the city. The transfer
took place on the 29th of January, 1518.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a></p>

<p>A division in the Church came to P&eacute;colat’s assistance.
Since the struggles between Victor and
Polycrat in the second century, between Cyprian
and Stephen in the third, dissensions between the
catholic bishops have never ceased; and in the
middle ages particularly, there were often severe
contests between the bishops and their metropolitans.
The Archbishop of Vienne did not understand
yielding to the Bishop of Geneva, and at the
very moment when Luther’s Theses were resounding
throughout Christendom&mdash;in 1517 and 1518&mdash;the
Roman Church on the banks of the Rhone was giving
a poor illustration of its pretended unity. The metropolitan,
finding his citations useless, ordered the
bishop to liberate P&eacute;colat, under pain of excommunication;<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a>
but the episcopal officers who remained in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
Geneva, only laughed, like their master, at the metropolitan
and his threats.</p>

<p>P&eacute;colat’s friends took the matter more seriously.
They feared for his life. Who could tell whether the
bastard had not left orders to get rid of the prisoner,
and left Geneva in order to escape the people’s anger?
These apprehensions were not without cause, for more
than one upright man was afterwards to be sacrificed
in the castle of Peney. Stephen P&eacute;colat and some of
his brother’s friends waited on St. Victor; ‘The superior
metropolitan authority has ordered P&eacute;colat to be
released,’ they said; ‘we shall go off straight in search
of him.’ The acute Bonivard represented to them
that the gaolers would not give him up, that the castle
was strong, and they would fail in the attack; that
the whole people should demand the liberation of the
innocent man detained by the bishop in his dungeons,
in despite of the liberties of the city and the orders
of his metropolitan. ‘A little patience,’ he continued;
‘we are near the beginning of Lent, holy week is not
far off; the interdict will then be published by the
metropolitan. The christians finding themselves
deprived of the sacrament will grow riotous, and
will compel the bishop’s officers to set our friend at
liberty. Thus the inhibition which we served upon
the bishop in his palace, will produce its effect in
despite of him.’ The advice was thought sound,
they agreed to it, and everybody in Geneva waited
with impatience for Easter and the excommunication.</p>

<p>Anthony de la Colombi&egrave;re, official to the metropolitan
of Vienne, arrived to execute the orders of his
superior, and having come to an understanding with
the prior of St. Victor and judge L&eacute;vrier, he ordered,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
on the 18th of March, that P&eacute;colat should be released
within twenty-four hours. He waited eight days, but
waited in vain, for the episcopal officers continued to
disobey him. Then, on Good Friday, the metropolitan
officers, bearing the sentence of excommunication and
interdict, proceeded to the cathedral at two o’clock in
the afternoon, and there, in the presence of John Gallatin,
notary, and three other witnesses, they posted up
the terrible monition; at four o’clock they did the same
at the churches of St. Gervais and St. Germain. This
was not indeed the thunder of the Vatican, but it was
nevertheless the excommunication of a prelate who,
at Geneva, filled the first place after the pope in the
Roman hierarchy. The canons, priests, and parishioners,
as they went to evening prayers, walked up to
the placards and were quite aghast as they read them.
‘We excommunicate,’ they ran, ‘the episcopal officers,
and order that this excommunication be published in
the churches, with bell, book, and candle. Moreover,
we command, under pain of the same excommunication,
the syndics and councillors to attack the castles
and prisons wherein P&eacute;colat is detained, and to liberate
him by force. Finally we pronounce the interdict
against all places wherein these excommunicates are
found. And if, like the deaf adder, they persist in
their wickedness, we interdict the celebration not
only of the sacraments, but also of divine service, in
the churches of St. Pierre, Notre Dame la Neuve, St.
Germain, St. Gervais, St. Victor, St. Leger, and Holy
Cross.’<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> After the canons and priests had read this
document, they halted in consternation at the threshold
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
of the church. They looked at one another, and asked
what was to be done. Having well considered, they
said: ‘Here’s a barrier we cannot get over,’ and they
retired.</p>

<p>As the number of devout catholics was still pretty
large in Geneva, what Bonivard had foreseen came
to pass; and the agitation was general. No more
services, no more masses, no baptisms, no marriages
... divine worship suspended, the cross hidden,
the altars stripped.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> ... What was to be done?
The chapter was sitting, and several citizens appeared
before them in great irritation. ‘It is you,’ they
said to the terrified canons, ‘that are the cause of all
this.’ ... Nor was this all. The excommunicates
of the Savoyard parishes of the diocese used to come
every year at the approach of Easter and petition the
bishop’s official for letters of <i>consentment</i>, in order that
their parish priests might give them the <i>communion</i>.
‘Now of such folks there chanced to be a great number
at Geneva. Heyday, they said, it is of no use
putting one obstacle aside, when another starts up
immediately, all owing to the fault of these episcopal
officers!’ ... The exasperated Savoyards united
with the Genevans, and the agitated crowd assembled
in front of the cathedral gates; the men murmured,
the women wept, even priests joined the laity. Loud
shouts were heard erelong. The people’s patience
was exhausted; they took part against their bishop.
‘To the Rhone,’ cried the devout, ‘to the Rhone
with the traitors! the villains who prevent us from
receiving our Lord!’ The excommunicated episcopal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
officers had a narrow escape from drowning. All the
diocese fancied itself excommunicated, and accordingly
the confusion extended beyond the city. The
syndics came up and entreated the citizens to be calm;
and then, going to the episcopal council, the bishop
being still absent, they said: ‘Release P&eacute;colat, or we
cannot protect you against the anger of the people.’
The episcopal officers seeing the bishop and the duke on
one side, the metropolitan and the people on the other,
and impelled in contrary directions, knew not whom
to obey. It was reported to them that all the city
was in an uproar, that the most devout catholics wished
at any cost to communicate on Easter Sunday, and
that looking upon them as the only obstacle which
prevented their receiving the host, they had determined
to throw them over the bridge. ‘The first of
you that comes out shall go over,’ cried the crowd.
They were seized with great alarm, and fancying
themselves half drowned already, wrote to the governor
of Peney to release P&eacute;colat forthwith. The
messenger departed, and the friends and relations of
the prisoner, not trusting to the episcopal court,
accompanied him. During the three-quarters of an
hour that the walk occupied, the crowd kept saying:&mdash;suppose
the governor should refuse to give up his
victim; suppose the bastard’s agents have already
carried him away&mdash;perhaps put him to death? None
of these suppositions was realised. Deep in a dungeon
of the castle, the poor man, heavily chained, in
utter darkness, wrecked both in mind and body, was
giving way to the blackest melancholy. Suddenly he
hears a noise. He listens; he seems to recognise well-known
voices: it was his brothers and his friends
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
arriving noisily under the walls of the castle, and
giving utterance to their joy.</p>

<p>Their success was, however, less certain than it
appeared to them. Strange things were, in fact,
taking place at that moment in Geneva. The bishop
and the duke had not been so passive as had been
imagined, and at the very instant when the messenger
bearing the order from the episcopal court, and
accompanied by a body of Genevans, was leaving by
the French gate, a courier, with an order from the
Roman court, entered by the Savoy gate. The latter
went with all speed to the bishop’s representatives,
and handed them the pontifical letters which the
princes had obtained, and by which the pope <i>annulled
the censures of the metropolitan</i>. This Roman messenger
brought in addition an order from the bishop
forbidding them <i>on their lives</i> to release P&eacute;colat. The
bastard had shuddered at the thought that the wretch
whom he had so successfully tortured, might escape
him: he had moved heaven and earth to keep him in
prison. We may imagine the emotion and alarm
which fell upon the episcopal councillors when they
read the letters handed to them. The coincidence of
the moment when these two contradictory orders left
Geneva and arrived there is so striking, that we may
ask whether these letters from Rome and Turin were
not supposed&mdash;invented by the episcopal officers
themselves; but there is nothing in the narrative to
indicate a trick. ‘<i>Immediately</i> on reading the letters,
the episcopal officers <i>with all diligence</i> countermanded
the release.’ These words in the ‘Annals’ show the
precipitation with which they endeavoured to repair the
mistake they had committed. There was not, in fact, a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
moment to lose, if they wished to keep P&eacute;colat. Several
officers got on horseback and set off full gallop.</p>

<p>The bearers of this order were hardly halfway,
when they met a numerous jubilant and noisy crowd
returning from Peney. The friends of P&eacute;colat,
preceded by the official letters addressed to the
governor, had appeared before that officer, who, after
reading the despatch over and over, had thought it
his duty to obey. P&eacute;colat’s friends hurried after the
gaoler, who, carrying a bunch of keys in his hand,
went to open the cell; they entered with him,
shouting release! They broke the prisoner’s chains;
and, finding him so weak, carried him in their arms
and laid him in the sunshine in the castle yard.
Without loss of time they placed him in a peasant’s
cart and all started for Geneva. This was
the crowd met by the episcopal officers. The
Genevans were bringing back their friend with
shouts of joy. In vain did the episcopal officers
stop this joyous band, and require that the prisoner
should be led back to Peney; in vain did they speak
of the bishop and even of the pope; all was of no
use. Despite the <i>rogations</i> of the pope, the prelate,
and the messengers, the people carried P&eacute;colat back
in triumph. This resistance offered to the Roman
pontiff, at the moment he was lending assistance to
the bastard in his oppression of a poor innocent
man, was, as it were, an affair of outposts; and the
Genevans were thus training themselves for more
notable battles. ‘Forward,’ they shouted, ‘to the
city! to the city!’ and the crowd, leaving the episcopal
officers alone in the middle of the road, hastened
to the gates.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span></p>

<p>At last they approached Geneva, and there the
excitement was not less great than on the road.
P&eacute;colat’s return was the triumph of right over injustice,
of liberty over despotism; and accordingly it
was celebrated with enthusiasm. The poor man,
dumb (for his wound was not yet healed), shattered
by the torture, and wasted away by his long captivity,
looked silently on all around him, and experienced
an emotion he could hardly contain. After
such trials he was returning into the old city amid
the joyous cries of the population. However, his
friends did not forget the orders of the pope and the
bishop; and fearing lest the vidame should again seize
the poor fellow, they took him to the convent of the
Grey Friars of Rive, an asylum reputed inviolable,
and quartered him in the cell of his brother, the
monk Yvonnet. There the poor invalid received all
the affectionate attendance he required; he remained
some time without saying much; but at last he recovered
his speech, ‘by the intercession of <i>a saint</i>,’
said the priests and P&eacute;colat himself, as it would
appear. Was it devoutly or jestingly that he spoke
of this pretended miraculous cure? We shall not
decide. Bonivard, who perhaps no longer believed
in the miracles of saints, assigns another reason:
‘The surgeons dressed the wound in his tongue;’
and he adds: ‘He always stuttered a little.’ If
Bonivard had doubts about the saints, he believed
in the sovereign justice of God: ‘Then came to pass
a thing,’ he said, ‘which should not be forgotten; all
the judges who condemned P&eacute;colat to be tortured
died this year, one after another, which we cannot
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
suppose to have happened except as a <i>divine
punishment</i>.’</p>

<p>The remembrance of P&eacute;colat’s torture long remained
in the memory of the citizens of Geneva, and
contributed to make them reject the rule of the
Romish bishops.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> In fact the interest felt for this
victim of episcopal cruelty was manifested in every
way. The cell of brother Yvonnet, in the Grey
Friars’ convent, was never empty; everybody wished
to see the bishop’s victim. The prior of St. Victor
was one of the first to come, attended by several
friends. The poor man, being tongue-tied, told ‘the
mystery of his sufferings with his fingers,’ says Bonivard.
It was long since there had been such an
interesting sight in Geneva. The citizens, standing
or sitting around him, could not turn their eyes away
from his thin pale face. By his gestures and attitudes
P&eacute;colat described the scenes of the examination, the
torture, and the razor, and in the midst of these remembrances
which made the tears come to his eyes,
he from time to time indulged in a joke. The young
men of Geneva looked at each other and trembled
with indignation ... and then sometimes they
laughed, at which the episcopal officers ‘were terribly
enraged.’ The latter were in truth both vexed and
angry. What! they receive an order from the bishop,
an order from the pope, and only a few minutes
before they have issued a contrary order! Strange
mishap! Not knowing whom to blame, they imprisoned
the governor, who had only released P&eacute;colat
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
by their command, and to cover their responsibility
were actually planning to put him to death.</p>

<p>Some timid and alarmed citizens dared not go and
see P&eacute;colat; one of these was Blanchet, the friend of
Andrew Navis, who had been present at the famous
meeting at the Molard and the <i>momon</i> supper, and
who, falling not long after beneath the bishop’s
violence, was doomed to expiate his errors by a most
cruel death. Blanchet is the type of a character frequent
at this epoch. Having learnt, shortly after the
famous <i>momon</i> banquet, that a certain individual
whose name even he did not know, but who, he said,
‘had given him the lie to his face,’ was in Burgundy,
Blanchet set off after him, gave him a box on the ears,
and returned. He came back to Geneva, thence he
went into Faucigny, and afterwards to Italy; he took
part in the war between the pope and the Duke of
Urbino (who so terribly frightened Leo X.); returned
to Pavia, thence to Turin, and finally to Geneva. His
cousin Peter, who lived in Turin, had told him that
during his travels P&eacute;colat had been arrested for
plotting against the bishop. ‘I shall not go and see
him,’ he said, ‘for fear of compromising myself.’ In
spite of his excessive precaution, he could not finally
escape the barbarous vengeance of the prelate.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.<br />

<span class="small">BERTHELIER TRIED AT GENEVA; BLANCHET AND NAVIS SEIZED
AT TURIN; BONIVARD SCANDALISED AT ROME.<br />

(1518.)</span></h2>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">No</span> one embraced P&eacute;colat with so much joy as
Berthelier, who had returned to Geneva within
these few days. In fact the duke, desirous to please
the Swiss by any means, had given him, and also made
the bishop give him, a safe-conduct which, bearing date
February 24, 1518, extended to Whitsunday, May
23, in the same year. The favour shown the republican
hero was not great, for permission was granted
him to return to Geneva <i>to stand his trial</i>; and the
friends of the prelate hoped that he would not only
be tried, but condemned and put to death. Notwithstanding
these forebodings, Berthelier, a man of spirit
and firm in his designs, was returning to his city to
accomplish the work he had prepared in Switzerland:
namely, the alliance of Geneva with the cantons. He
had taken great trouble about it during his residence
among the confederates. He was seen continually
‘visiting, eating, drinking in the houses of his friends
or at the guilds (called abbeys), talking with the
townsfolk, and proving to them that this alliance
would be of great use to all the country of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
League.’ Berthelier was then full of hope; Geneva
was showing herself worthy of liberty; there was an
energetic movement towards independence; the people
were wearied of the tyranny of princes. Free voices
were heard in the general council. ‘No one can
serve two masters,’ said some patriots. ‘The man who
holds any pension or employment from a prince, or has
taken an oath to other authorities than the republic,
ought not to be elected either syndic or councillor.’
This resolution was carried by a large majority.
And better still, the citizens chose for syndics three
men capable of guarding the franchises of the community;
they were Ramel, Vandel, and Besan&ccedil;on
Hugues. A mameluke, ‘considering the great credit
of the party,’ had also been elected, but only one,
Montyon; he was the premier syndic.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a></p>

<p>Whilst the patriots were thus making efforts to
save the independence of the city, the duke, the
bishop, the count, Archbishop Seyssel, and other councillors,
meeting at Turin, were pursuing contrary
schemes. Would they succeed? Seyssel, the illustrious
author of the <i>Grande Monarchie</i>, might tell
them that in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, in
France, Burgundy, and Flanders, the bishop and the
lay lord had combined against the liberties of the
towns, and aided by arms and anathemas had maintained
a war against the communes which had ended
in the destruction of the rights and franchises of
the citizens. Then the night was indeed dark in
the social world. At Geneva, these rights existed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
still: you could see a flickering light glimmering
feebly in the midst of the darkness. But would
not the bishop and the duke succeed in extinguishing
it? If so, despotism would hold all Europe
under its cruel hand, as in the Mahometan and other
countries of the world. Why should the operation
carried through at Cambray, Noyon, St. Quentin,
Laon, Amiens, Soissons, Sens, and Rheims, fail on the
shores of the Leman? There was indeed a reason
for it, but they did not take it into account. We do
not find this reason&mdash;at least not alone&mdash;in the fact
that the heroes of liberty were more intrepid at Geneva
than elsewhere. The enfranchisement was to come
from a higher source: God then brought forth light and
liberty. The middle ages were ending, modern times
were beginning. The princes and bishops of Roman
Catholicism, in close alliance, had everywhere reduced
to ashes the edifice of communal liberties. But
in the midst of these ashes some embers were found
which, kindled again by fire from heaven, lighted up
once more in the world the torch of lawful liberty.
Geneva was the obstacle to the definite annihilation
of the popular franchises, and in Geneva the
strength of the obstacle was Berthelier. No wonder
then that the Savoyard princes agreed that in order to
check the triumph of the spirit of independence, it
was absolutely necessary to get rid of this proud,
energetic, and unyielding citizen. They began to
prepare the execution of their frightful project. A
strange blindness is that which imagines that by
removing a man from the world it is possible to
thwart the designs of God!</p>

<p>Berthelier, calm because he was innocent, provided
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
besides with an episcopal safe-conduct, had appeared
before the syndics to be tried. The duke and the
bishop had given orders to their agents, the vidame
Conseil and Peter Navis, the procurator-fiscal, to manage
his condemnation. The trial began: ‘You are
charged,’ said these two magistrates, ‘with having
taken part in the riotous amusements of the young
men of Geneva.’&mdash;‘I desired,’ answered Berthelier
frankly, ‘to keep up the good-will of those who were
contending for liberty against the usurpations of tyrants.’
The justification was worse than the charge.
‘Let us seize him by the throat, as if he were a
wolf,’ said the two judges. ‘You have conspired,’
they continued, ‘against the life of the prince-bishop,’
and they handed in P&eacute;colat’s depositions as proof.
‘All lies,’ said Berthelier coldly, ‘lies extorted by
the rack and retracted afterwards.’ Navis then produced
the declarations of the traitor Carmentrant,
who, as we have seen at the <i>momon</i> supper, undertook
the office of informer. ‘Carmentrant!’ contemptuously
exclaimed the accused, ‘one of the
bishop’s servants, coming and going to the palace
every day, eating, drinking, and making merry ...
a pretty witness indeed! The bishop has prevailed
upon him, by paying him well, to suffer himself to
be sent to prison, so that he may sing out against
me whatever they prompt him with ... Carmentrant
boasts of it himself!’ When they sent the report
to the bishop, he perceived, on reading it, that
this examination, instead of demonstrating the guilt of
the accused, only revealed the iniquity of the accuser;
the alarmed prelate therefore wrote to the vidame
and Navis to ‘use every imaginable precaution.’ It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
was necessary to destroy Berthelier without compromising
the bishop.</p>

<p>Navis was the man for that. Of a wily and
malicious character, he understood nothing about
the liberties of Geneva; but he was a skilful and
a crafty lawyer. ‘He so mixes retail truth with
wholesale falsehood,’ people said, ‘that he makes
you believe the whole lump is true. If any iniquity
of the bishop’s is discovered, straight he cuts
a plug to stop the hole. He is continually forging
new counts, and calling for adjournments.’ Navis,
finding himself at the end of his resources, began
to turn and twist the safe-conduct every way: it expressly
forbade the detention of Berthelier’s person.
That mattered not. ‘I demand that Berthelier be
arrested,’ he said, ‘and be examined in custody; for
the safe-conduct, if you weigh it well, is not opposed
to this.’<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a>&mdash;‘The first of virtues,’ said Berthelier, ‘is
to keep your promise.’ Navis, little touched by this
morality, resolved to obtain his request by dint of
importunity; the next day he required that ‘Berthelier
should be shut up closely in prison;’ on the
20th of April, he moved that ‘he should be incarcerated;’
and on the following day, he made the
same request; about the end of May he demanded
on two different occasions, not only that ‘the noble
citizen should be arrested but tortured also.’ ...
All these unjust prayers were refused by the court.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a>
Navis, being embarrassed and irritated, multiplied his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
accusations; his plaint was like an overflowing
torrent: ‘The accused,’ he said, ‘is a brawler,
fighter, promoter of quarrels, illegal meetings, and
seditions, rebellious to the prince and his officers,
accustomed to carry out his threats, a debaucher of
the young men of the city, and all without having
ever been corrected of his faults and excesses.’&mdash;‘I
confess that I am not corrected of these faults,’
answered Berthelier with disdain, ‘because I never
was guilty of them.’<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> It was determined to associate
with the syndics some commissioners devoted to the
bishop; but the syndics replied that this would be
contrary to law. The vidame and Navis, not knowing
what to do next, wrote to the duke and the
prelate to find some good grievances. ‘You shall
have them,’ they answered; ‘we have certain witnesses
to examine here, this side the mountains.’ ...
Who were these witnesses? Navis little imagined
that one of them was his own son, and that the
inquiry would end in a catastrophe that would extort
from him a cry of anguish. Let us now see what was
going on at Turin.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a></p>

<p>Blanchet, disgusted with his condition since he had
been to the wars, cared little for Geneva. During
his sojourn at Turin, in the house of the magnificent
lord of Meximieux, the splendour of the establishment
had dazzled him. His love for liberty had
cooled down, his taste for the luxuries and comforts
of life had increased. ‘I will seek patrons and fortune,’
he often repeated. With this object he returned
from Geneva to Turin. It was the moment when the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
bishop was on the watch to catch one of the ‘children
of Geneva.’ Blanchet was seized and thrown into
prison; and that was not all.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a></p>

<p>Andrew Navis, who, since the affair of the mule,
had led a more regular life, was dreadfully weary
of his father’s office. One Sunday, M. de Vernier
gave his friends a splendid breakfast, to which Navis
and Blanchet had been invited. Andrew was never
tired of hearing ‘the wanderer’ talk about Italy,
its delightful landscapes, the mildness of its climate,
its fruits, monuments, pictures, concerts, theatres,
beautiful women, and of the war between the pope
and the Duke of Urbino. A desire to cross the Alps
took possession of Andrew. ‘As soon as there is
any rumour at Geneva of a foreign war,’ he said,
‘some of my companions hasten to it: why should I
not do the same?’ The Duke of Urbino, proud of the
secret support of France, was at that time a cause of
great alarm to Leo X. An open war against a pope
tempted Navis. The vices from which he suffered
were not those base errors which nullify a man;
but those ardent faults, those energetic movements
which leave some hope of conversion. Leaning on
his father’s desk, disgusted with the pettifogging
business, he felt the need of a more active life. An
opportunity presented itself. A woman named
Georgia, with whom he had formerly held guilty
intercourse, having to go to Turin, to join a man who
was not her husband, asked Andrew to be her escort,
promising him ‘a merry time of it.’ Navis made up his
mind, and without his father’s knowledge left Geneva
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
and his friends, and reached Turin at noon of Saturday
the 8th of May. One Gabriel Gervais, a Genevan,
was waiting for him: ‘Be on your guard,’ he said;
‘Blanchet has been taken up for some misunderstandings
with the bishop.’ The son of the procurator-fiscal
thought he had nothing to fear. But on the
morrow, about six o’clock in the evening, the same
Gabriel Gervais came and told him hastily: ‘They
are going to arrest you: make your escape.’ Andrew
started off directly, but was caught as he was about
to leave the city and taken to the castle.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a></p>

<p>The bishop and the duke wished, by arresting these
young Genevans, to punish their independent spirit, and
above all to extort from them confessions of a nature
to procure the condemnation of Berthelier and other
patriots. On the 26th of April the Bishop of Geneva
had issued his warrant to all the ducal officers, and,
in his quality of peaceful churchman, had concluded
with these words: ‘We protest we have no desire, so
far as in us lies, that any penalty of blood or death
should result, or any mutilation of limbs, or other
thing that may give rise to any irregularity.’<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> We
shall see with what care the bishop avoided <i>mutilation
of limbs</i>. The duke issued his warrant the
same day.</p>

<p>Blanchet’s examination began on the 3rd of May
in the court of the castle of Turin. He believed
himself accused of an attempt upon the life of the
bishop, and doubted not that torture and perhaps a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
cruel death were reserved for him; accordingly this
young man, of amiable but weak disposition, became a
prey to the blackest melancholy. On the 5th of May,
having been brought back to the court of the castle,
he turned to the lieutenant De Bresse, who assisted
the procurator-fiscal, and without waiting to be interrogated,
he said: ‘I am innocent of the crime of
which I am accused.’&mdash;‘And of what are you accused?’
said the lieutenant. Blanchet made no answer, but burst
into tears. The procurator-fiscal then commenced
the examination, and Blanchet began to cry again.
On being skilfully questioned, he allowed himself to
be surprised, and made several depositions against
Berthelier and the other patriots; then perceiving his
folly, he stopped short and exclaimed with many
groans: ‘I shall never dare return to Geneva! my
comrades would kill me.... I implore the mercy of
my lord duke.’ Poor Blanchet moved even his
judges to pity. Navis, when led before the same
tribunal on the 10th of May, did not weep. ‘Who
are you?’ they asked. ‘I am from Geneva,’ he
replied, ‘scrivener, notary, a gentleman’s son, and
twenty-eight years old.’ The examination was not
long. The bishop, who was then at Pignerol, desired
to have the prisoners in his own hand, as he
had once held P&eacute;colat; they were accordingly removed
thither.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a></p>

<p>On the 14th, 15th,and 21st of May, Navis and Blanchet
were brought into the great hall of the castle before
the magnificent John of Lucerne, collateral of the council,
and Messire d’Ancina. ‘Speak as we desire you,’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
said the collateral, ‘and then you will be in his Highness’s
good graces.’ As they did not utter a word,
they were at first threatened with two turns of the
cord, and that not being sufficient, they were put to
the rack; they were fastened to the rope, and raised
an arm’s length from the floor. Navis was in agony;
but instead of inculpating Berthelier, he accused
himself. The commandment which says: ‘Honour
thy father and thy mother,’ was continually in his
mind, and he felt that it was in consequence of
breaking it, that he had fallen into dissipation and
disgrace. ‘Alas!’ said he, when put to the question,
‘I have been a vagabond, disobedient to my father,
roaming here and there, squandering my own and
my father’s money in taverns.... Alas! I have
not been dutiful to my parents.... If I had been
obedient, I should not have suffered as I do to-day.’
On the 10th of June, says the report, he was again put
to the torture and pulled up the height of an ell. After
remaining there a moment, Navis begged to be let
down, promising to tell everything. Then sitting on
a bench, he accused himself bitterly of the crime of
which he felt himself guilty; he confessed ... to
having <i>disobeyed his parents</i>.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> Peter Navis was a
passionate judge in the opinion of many; Andrew
saw only the father in him; and contempt of paternal
authority was the great sin that agonised the wretched
young man. Looking into himself, foreseeing the
fatal issue of the trial, he did not give way, like
Blanchet, to the fear of death, but bewailed his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
faults. Family recollections were aroused in his
heart, the most sacred of bonds recovered their
strength, and the image of his father followed him
night and day.</p>

<p>The bishop had got thus far in his prosecutions when
he learnt that Bonivard had just passed through Turin
on his way to Rome. Delighted at seeing the prior of
St. Victor fall into his net, the prelate gave orders to
seize him on his return. Was it not Bonivard who had
caused him such alarm in the palace on the occasion
of the metropolitan summons? Was it not this man
who had robbed him of P&eacute;colat, and who even aspired
to sit some day on his episcopal throne?... It is the
nature of certain animals to carry their prey into their
dens to devour it. The bastard of Savoy had already
dragged Navis and Blanchet into his dungeons, and
was preparing to mutilate their limbs; but it would
be much better still if he could catch and rend the
hated Bonivard with his claws.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a></p>

<p>The latter so little suspected the impending danger,
that he had come into Italy to solicit the prelate’s inheritance.
It was evident that the sickly bastard had
not long to live. ‘I will go to Rome,’ said Bonivard
to his friends, ‘to obtain the bishop’s benefices by
means of a <i>cardination</i>’ (an intrigue of cardinals).<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a>
He desired eagerly to be bishop and prince of Geneva;
had he succeeded, his liberal catholicism would perhaps
have sufficed for the citizens, and prevented the
Reformation. Bonivard reached Rome without any
obstacle six years after Luther, and like the reformer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
was at once struck by the corruption which prevailed
there. ‘The Church,’ he said, ‘is so full of bad
humours, that it has become dropsical.’<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> It was in
the pontificate of Leo X.; all that priests, monks,
bishops, and cardinals thought about was being present
at farces and comedies, and of going masked to
courtesans’ houses.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> Bonivard saw all this with his
own eyes, and has left us some stories into which he
has admitted expressions we must soften, and details
we must suppress. ‘Having business one day with
the concubinary of the pope’s cubicular (we leave these
unusual expressions, the meaning of which is not very
edifying), I had to go and find him at a courtesan’s....
She wore smart feathers, waving over a fine gold
coif, and a silk dress with slashed sleeves; you would
have taken her for a princess.’<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> Another day, while
walking in the city, he met one of these ‘misses,’ disguised
as a man, and riding on a Spanish jennet; on
the crupper behind her was a <i>janin</i> wrapped in a
Spanish cape, which he drew carefully over his nose
so that he might not be recognised. ‘Who is he?’
asked Bonivard. ‘It is Cardinal So-and-so with his
favourite,’ was the reply. ‘We say in my country,’
he rejoined, ‘that all the madmen are not at Rome;
and yet I see you have them in abundance.’<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a></p>

<p>The prior of St. Victor did not lose sight of the
object of his journey, and canvassed unceasingly; but
began to despair of success. ‘Do you wish to know,’
he was asked, ‘what you must do to obtain a request
from the pope and cardinals? Tell them that you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
will kill any man whom they have a grudge against;
or that you are ready to serve them in their pleasures,
to bring them <i>la donna</i>, to gamble, play the ruffian,
and rake with them&mdash;in short, that you are a libertine.’
Bonivard was not strict; yet he was surprised that
things had come to such a pass in the capital of catholicism.
His mind, eager to learn, asked what were
the causes of this decline.... He ascribed it to the disappearance
of christian individualism from the Church,
so that a personal conversion, a new creature, was required
no longer. ‘That in the first place,’ he said,
‘because when princes became christians, their whole
people was baptised with them. Discipline has been
since then like a spider’s web which catches the small
flies, but cannot hold the large ones. And next it
comes from the example of the popes.... I have
lived to see three pontiffs. First, Alexander VI.,
a <i>sharp fellow</i>,<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> a ne’er-do-well, an Italianised
Spaniard,&mdash;and what was worst of all,&mdash;at Rome!
a man without conscience, without God, who
cared for nothing, provided he accomplished his
desires. Next came Julius II., proud, choleric,
studying his bottle more than his breviary; mad
about his popedom, and having no thought but
how he could subdue not only the earth, but heaven
and hell.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> Last appeared Leo X., the present pope,
learned in Greek and Latin, but especially a good
musician, a great glutton, a deep drinker; possessing
beautiful pages whom the Italians style <i>ragazzi</i>;
always surrounded by musicians, buffoons, play-actors,
and other jesters; accordingly when he was informed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
of any new business, he would say: <i>Di grazia,
lasciatemi godere queste papate in pace; Domine mio
me la ha date. Andate da Monsignor di Medici</i>.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> ...
Everything is for sale at the court: red hats, mitres,
judgeships, croziers, abbeys, provostries, canonries....
Above all do not trust to Leo the Tenth’s word;
for he maintains that since he dispenses others from
their oaths, he can surely dispense himself.’<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a></p>

<p>Bonivard, astonished at the horrible state into
which popes and cardinals, priests and monks, had
sunk the Church, asked whence could salvation
come.... It was not six months since Prierias, master
of the sacred palace, had published a book entitled:
<i>Dialogue against the Presumptuous Propositions of
Martin Luther</i>.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> ‘Leo X. and his predecessors,’ said
Bonivard, ‘have always taken the Germans for beasts:
<i>pecora campi</i>, they were called, and rightly too, for
these simple Saxons allowed themselves to be saddled
and ridden like asses. The popes threatened them
with cudgelling (excommunication), enticed them
with thistles (indulgences), and so made them trot
to the mill to bring away the meal for them. But
having one day loaded the ass too heavily, Leo made
him jib, so that the flour was spilt and the white
bread lost. That ass (he added) is called <i>Martin</i>, like
all asses, and his surname is <i>Luther</i>, which signifies
<i>enlightener</i>.’<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a></p>

<p>They found at Rome that Bonivard had not the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
complaisance necessary for a Roman bishop; and the
prior, seeing that he had no chance of success, shook
the dust off his feet against the metropolis of catholicism,
and departed for Turin. His journey had
not, however, been useless: he had learnt a lesson
which he never forgot, and which he told all his life
through to any one that would listen to him. When
he reached Turin, he went to visit his old friends
of the university, but they cried out with alarm:
‘Navis and Blanchet are within a hair’s-breadth of
death, and it has been decided to arrest you. Fly without
losing a moment.’ Bonivard remained. Ought he
to leave in the talons of the vulture those two young
men with whom he had so often laughed at the noisy
banquets of ‘the children of Geneva?’ He resolved
to do what he could to interest his friends in their
fate. For a whole week he went from house to
house, and walked through the streets without any
disguise. Nothing seemed easier than to lay hands
on him, and the ducal police would have attempted it,
but he was never alone. The scholars, charmed with
his spirit and independence, accompanied him everywhere,
and these thoughtless headstrong youths would
have defended him at the cost of their blood. Bonivard,
wishing to employ every means, wrote by some
secret channel to Blanchet and Navis; the gaoler
intercepted the letter, and took it to the bishop,
who, fancying he saw in it a conspiracy hatching
against him, even in Turin, pressed the condemnation
of the prisoners, and ordered Bonivard to be seized
immediately. Informed of what awaited him, the
intelligent prior displayed great tranquillity. ‘I shall
stay a month longer at Turin,’ he told everybody,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
‘to enjoy myself with my old friends.’ Many
invitations being given him, he accepted them all;
but the next day, before it was light, he took horse
and galloped off for Geneva.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span></p>

<span class="small">BLANCHET AND NAVIS EXECUTED. THEIR LIMBS SUSPENDED
TO THE WALNUT-TREE NEAR THE BRIDGE OF ARVE.<br />

(<span class="smcap">October 1518.</span>)</span></h2>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> bastard was staggered when he was informed
that Bonivard had escaped. He consoled himself,
however, with the thought that he had at hand
the means of gratifying his tastes and his revenge,
and concentrated all his attention on Navis and
Blanchet. What should he do with these two young
men who had so thoughtlessly fallen into his net?
How, in striking them, could he best strike the
independent men of Geneva? For he was not thinking
merely of getting rid of these two adventurers,
but of filling all the city with terror by means of
their death. To no purpose was he reminded that
the father of one of the prisoners was the most
zealous of his officers; the bastard cared little for
a father’s grief, and thought that Peter Navis would
serve him still better, when he had given him a
striking example of the manner in which he desired
to be served. He pressed the court to hasten on
the trial. Ancina, judge in criminal matters;
Caracci, seignior of Farges, and attorney-general of
Savoy; and Licia, his deputy, constituted by ducal
letters judges of Navis and Blanchet, declared
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
them solemnly convicted, first, of having been
present at the meeting at the Molard, and of having
promised, they and their accomplices, to be ‘unanimous
against the bishop’s officers, to rescue out of
their hands any of their number whom these episcopal
agents might take into custody; second, of
having proposed, in case the duke should take part
against them, to flee and place themselves under
a foreign government (Switzerland), abandoning
thus the sovereignty of Savoy and the splendour of
the white cross.’ The two prisoners were condemned
to be beheaded, and then quartered, according to
the bishop’s desire. They prepared for execution
immediately.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a></p>

<p>Navis breathed not a murmur; the feeling of his
disobedience to his father closed his lips; it appears
also that Blanchet recovered from his terror, dried
his tears, and acknowledged his folly. Nothing
indicates that the repentance of these two Genevan
youths was truly christian; but it would be unjust
to overlook their noble confession at the hour of
death. The provost and his men, having received
them from the hands of the magistrates, led them
to the place of execution. Their appearance was
becoming, and their look serious; they walked between
their guards, calm, but without weakness or
alarm. When they had mounted the scaffold, Navis
spoke: ‘Wishing before all things to make amends
for the evil we have done, we retract all that we
have said touching certain of our countrymen, and
declare that such avowals were extorted from us
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
by the fear of torture. After proclaiming the innocence
of others, we acknowledge ourselves guilty.
Yes, we have lived in such a way that we justly
deserve death, and we pray God, in this our last
hour, to pardon our sins. Yet understand, that
these sins are not those of which we are accused;
we have done nothing contrary to the franchises
and laws of Geneva: of that we are clean....
The sins which condemn us are our debaucheries.’
Navis would have continued, but the provost, vexed
at what he had said already, ordered the executioner
to do his duty. The man set to work instantly:
the two young men knelt down, he raised
his sword, and ‘thus they were beheaded, and then
quartered.’<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a></p>

<p>At last the bishop saw his desires satisfied; he
had in his possession the heads and the quarters
of two of the ‘children of Geneva.’ This little man,
so frail, livid, hideous, reduced almost to a shadow,
without genius and without will, had nevertheless the
will and the genius of evil. Notwithstanding his
protest against <i>the mutilation of limbs</i>, he decided that
three of the quarters of the two bodies should be
exposed over the gates of Turin, and reserved for
his own share a quarter of Navis and of Blanchet,
with the two heads. He had the flesh pickled, for
he intended to keep them as long as possible; and
when this savage operation, worthy of the Mohawks,
was completed, he placed the heads and limbs in
two barrels on which were marked the arms of the
count, the duke’s brother. The bishop wished to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
show his flock a sample of his cleverness; and as
the execution did not take place at Geneva, he intended
at least to send the limbs of the victims ‘to
stir up and terrify the scoundrels.’ The bearers
of these two pickle-tubs started from Turin, crossed
Mont Cenis, arrived in the basin of the Leman on
Saturday, October 2, 1518, and lodged on ‘the other
side of the Arve.’<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a></p>

<p>On the bank of this river, which then separated
the ducal states from those of Geneva, at the foot
of the bridge on the Savoy side, stood a fine
walnut-tree, whose leafy branches spread opposite
the church of Our Lady of Grace on the Genevan
side. The bishop’s agents, who had received orders
to make an exhibition of the mutilated limbs
for the benefit of the Genevans, proceeded to the
bridge on Saturday night in order to discharge
their disgraceful commission under cover of the
darkness. They carried with them, in addition to
their casks filled with flesh, brine, and blood, a ladder,
a hammer, some nails and cord. On reaching
the tree, they opened the barrels and found the features
well preserved and easily recognisable. The
bastard’s agents climbed the tree, and nailed the
heads and arms to the branches in such a manner
as to be seen by all the passers-by. They fixed
a placard underneath, bearing these words: ‘These
are the traitors of Geneva;’ and the white cross
of Savoy above. They then withdrew, leaving the
empty casks at the foot of the tree. ‘It was done
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
by order of your bishop,’ said the duke in a letter
written three days later (October 5) to his very
dear, beloved, and trusty citizens of Geneva, ‘your
bishop, whom we have in this supported and favoured,
which ought to be to your contentment.’<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a></p>

<p>The day broke, the people arose, opened their
windows, and went out of their houses; some were
going to the city. One man was about to cross
the bridge, when, fancying he saw something strange,
he drew near, and discovered with astonishment
human limbs hanging from the tree. He shuddered,
supposing that this had been done by some murderers
in mere bravado; and, wishing to make the
extraordinary occurrence known, he quickened his
steps. ‘The first who saw this mystery did not
keep it secret, but ran and told the news all through
the city. “What’s the matter?” people asked ...
and then everybody hurried thither,’ adds the chronicler.
In truth, an immense crowd of citizens&mdash;men,
women, and children&mdash;soon gathered round
the tree. It was Sunday, a day which the bastard
had probably selected for this edifying sight; every
one was free from his ordinary occupations, and
during all that holy day an agitated multitude
pressed continually around the tree where the blood-stained
remains of the two victims were hanging.
They looked closely at them and examined the
features: ‘It is Navis,’ they said; ‘it is Blanchet.’ ...
‘Ah!’ exclaimed a huguenot, ‘it is not
difficult to penetrate the mystery. It is one of my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
lord bishop’s messages come to us by the Turin
post!’ Bonivard, who had returned to Geneva,
thought himself fortunate that the swiftness of his
horse had carried him beyond the prelate’s reach,
and rejoiced that his head was not between those
of Blanchet and Navis; but he was at the same
time filled with indignation and anger against
the monster who had so treated his two young
friends. The Genevan youth indulged in bitter
irony. ‘A fine maypole they have raised us this
morning on the city boundary!’ they said; ‘they
have put up a flag already; it only wants a few
ribands and flowers to make the show complete!’
But the sight of these bloody fragments, swinging
in the air, was no fit subject for jesting; there was
great mourning in the city; groans and weeping
were heard in the crowd; women gave vent to
their horror, and men to their indignation.</p>

<p>Navis’s father, a man detested by the Genevans,
was not the last to be informed; some people ran
to tell him of the tragic event that was stirring
up the whole city. ‘Come,’ said they, ‘come and
see the reward the bishop sends you for your faithful
services. You are well paid; the tyrants recompense
you right royally for the disfavour you have
won from all of us; they have sent from Turin,
as your pay, the head of your son.’ ... Peter
Navis might be an unjust judge, but he was a
father: at first he was overwhelmed. Andrew had
been disobedient, but the ingratitude of the child
had not been able to extinguish the love of the
parent. The unhappy man, divided between affection
for his son and respect for his prince, shed tears
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
and endeavoured to hide them. Prostrated by grief
and shame, pale and trembling, he bent his head in
sullen silence. It was not the same with the mother,
who gave way to the most violent affection and most
extravagant despair. The grief of Navis’s parents,
which was expressed in such different ways, struck
all the spectators. Bonivard, who at this tragic moment
mingled in the agitated groups of the citizens,
was heart-stricken by all he saw and heard, and on
returning to his priory exclaimed: ‘What horror and
indignation such a spectacle excites! even strangers,
whom it does not affect, are disgusted at it....
What will the poor citizens do now? the poor relations
and friends? their father and mother?’ ...</p>

<p>The Genevans did not confine themselves to useless
lamentations; they did not turn their eyes to the
blow they had just received, they looked to the hand
that struck it; it was the hand of their bishop.
Everybody knew the failings of Navis and Blanchet,
but at this moment no one spoke of them; they could
only see two young and unhappy martyrs of liberty.
The anger of the people rose impetuously, and poured
itself out on the prelate more than on the duke.
‘The bishop,’ they said, ‘is a wolf under a shepherd’s
cloak. Would you know how he feeds his
lambs, go to the bridge of Arve!’ Their leaders
thought the same: they said, it was not enough for
the prince-bishop to plunge families and a whole city
into mourning, but his imagination coldly calculated
the means of increasing their sorrow. These suspended
heads and arms were a notable instance of
that cruel faculty of invention which has always distinguished
tyrants. To torture in Piedmont the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
bodies of their young friends did not satisfy the prelate,
but he must torture all hearts in Geneva. What
is the spirit that animates him? What are the secret
motives of these horrible executions?... Despotism,
self-interest, fanaticism, hatred, revenge, cruelty,
ambition, folly, madness.... It was indeed
all these together. Think not that he will stop in
the midst of his success: these are only the first-fruits
of his tenderness. To draw up proscription
lists, to butcher the friends of liberty, to expose their
dead bodies, to kill Geneva,&mdash;in one word, to take
pattern by Sylla in everything,<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a>&mdash;such will henceforward
be the <i>cure of souls</i> of this son of the
pope.</p>

<p>The resistance of the citizens to the encroachments
of the prelate assumed from that hour a character that
must necessarily lead to the abolition of the Roman
episcopacy in Geneva. There is a retributive justice
from which princes cannot escape, and it is often the
innocent successors who are hurled from their thrones
by the crimes of their guilty predecessors; of this
we have seen numerous examples during the past
half-century. The penalty which has not fallen on
the individual falls on the family or the institution;
but the penalty which strikes the institution is the
more terrible and instructive. The mangled limbs
hanging on the banks of the Arve left an indelible
impression on the minds of the Genevan people. If a
mameluke and a huguenot happened to pass the bridge
together, the first, pointing to the walnut-tree, would say
to the second with a smile: ‘Do you recognise Navis
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
and Blanchet?’&mdash;the huguenot would coldly reply: ‘I
recognise my bishop.’<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> The institution of a bishop-prince,
an imitation of that of a bishop-king, became
every day more hateful to the Genevans. Its end
was inevitable&mdash;its end at Geneva: hereafter the
judgments of God will overtake it in other places
also.</p>

<p>The agitation was not confined to the people: the
syndics had summoned the council. ‘This morning,’
they said, ‘before daybreak, two heads and two arms
were fastened to a tree opposite the church of Our
Lady of Grace. We know not by whose order.’<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a>
Everybody guessed whose heads they were and by
whose order they had been exposed; but the explosion
was not so great in the council as in the crowd. They
must have understood that this cruel act betokened
sinister designs; they heard the thunder-clap that precedes
the storm: yet each man drew a different conclusion.
Certain canons, monks, and other agents of
the Roman Church, accomplices of the tyrant, called
for absolute submission. Certain nobles thought that
if they were freed from the civic councils, they
could display their aristocratic pretensions more at
their ease. Certain traders, Savoyards by birth, who
loved better ‘large gains in slavery than small gains
in liberty,’ amused themselves by thinking that if the
duke became master of the city, he would reside there
with his court, and they would get a higher price for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
their goods. But the true Genevans joyfully consented
that their country should be small and poor,
provided it were the focus of light and liberty. As
for the huguenots, the two heads were the signal of
resistance. ‘With an adversary that keeps any measure,’
they said, ‘we may relax a little of our rights;
but there are no considerations to be observed with
an enemy who proceeds by murder.... Let us throw
ourselves into the arms of the Swiss.’</p>

<p>The bishop’s crime thus became one of the stages
on the road to liberty. No doubt the victims were
culpable, but the murderers were still more so. All
that was noble in Geneva sighed for independence.
The mameluke magistrates strove in vain to excuse
an act which injured their cause; they were answered
rudely; contrary opinions were bandied to and fro in
the council, and ‘there was a great disturbance.’ At
last they resolved to send an ambassador to the princes
to inquire whether this barbarous act had been perpetrated
by their orders, and in that case to make
remonstrances. This resolution was very displeasing
to the mamelukes, who endeavoured to soften the
harsh message by intrusting it to pleasing messengers.
‘To obtain what you desire from princes, you must
send them people who are agreeable to them,’ said the
first syndic. The assembly accordingly named the
vidame Aymon Conseil, an unblushing agent of Savoy;
the ex-syndic Nergaz, a bad man and personal enemy of
Berthelier; and D&eacute;l&eacute;amont, governor of Peney, against
whom the huguenots had more than once drawn the
sword. The duke, being at that time in his Savoy
provinces, received the deputation coldly at a public
audience, but made much of them in private. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
ambassadors returned in three days with an unmeaning
answer.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a></p>

<p>The bishop was at Pignerol, where he had presided
over the terrible butchery. The council were content
to write to him, considering the distance; and as he
was still proud of his exploit, he replied by extolling
the mildness of his government: ‘You have never had
prince or prelate with such good intentions as myself,’
he wrote from Turin on the 15th of October; ‘the
execution done the other side the bridge of Arve is to
give those a lesson who desire to lead evil lives.’ Accordingly
the bastard exhorted the Genevans to show
themselves sensible of his kindness by returning him
a double share of love. These executions, far from
causing him any remorse, gave him a longing for more;
he invited the Genevans to acknowledge his tender
favours by granting him the head of Berthelier and a
few others besides. Making confession to the council
of his most secret anguish, he expressed a fear that if
these heads did not fall before his return, it would
prevent his enjoying the pleasures of the table. ‘Discharge
your duty,’ said he, ‘so that when I am with you,
there may be nothing to do but to make <i>good cheer</i>.’
To live merrily and to put his most illustrious
subjects to death were the two chief points of his
episcopal cure of souls. To be more sure of obtaining
these heads, he threatened Geneva with his vengeance:
‘If you should refuse,’ said he in conclusion, ‘understand
clearly that I shall pray my lord (the duke)
and his brother (the count) to preserve my good
rights; and I have confidence in them, that they will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
not let me be trampled upon; besides this, I will
risk my life and my goods.’ This mild pastoral was
signed: <span class="smcap">The Bishop</span> of Geneva.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a></p>

<p>Thus everybody was leaguing against Geneva.
Would it be crushed? Was there in this small
republic strength enough to resist the twofold lay
and clerical opposition, which had crushed so many
free cities in the dark ages? There were influences
at work, as we have seen, in the formation of modern
liberties, and we find in Geneva the representatives of
the three great schools in which Europe has learnt
the principles of government. The characteristic of
the German liberties was an energetic love of independence;
now Berthelier and many of his friends
were true Germans in this respect. The characteristic
of the Roman liberties was legality; we find this
strongly marked in L&eacute;vrier and other eminent men.
The third element of the independence of this people
was to be that christian principle which, subjecting
the conscience to God, and thus giving man a firmness
more than human, makes him tread in the path of
liberty and walk along precipices without his head
turning or his feet stumbling. Yet a few years more,
and a great number of Genevans will find this latter
element in the Gospel. To this Geneva owes principally
the maintenance of her existence.</p>

<p>After the murder of Blanchet and Navis, the passion
of independence became dominant. ‘From that time,’
said a magistrate of the seventeenth century, ‘the duke
and bishop were looked upon in Geneva as two tyrants
who sought only the desolation of the city.’<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.<br />

<span class="small">THE HUGUENOTS PROPOSE AN ALLIANCE WITH THE SWISS, AND
THE MAMELUKES AMUSE THEMSELVES AT TURIN.<br />

(<span class="smcap">October to December 1518.</span>)</span></h2>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> moment had come when men of decision were
about to apply themselves to the work. The
patriots learnt that the encroaching designs of Savoy
were irrevocable, and that it was consequently necessary
to oppose them with an energetic and unbending
resistance. Berthelier, ‘the great despiser of death,’
smiled coldly at the bishop’s threats; magnanimous,
firm, and resolute, he fancied he saw the happy moment
approaching when his fondest dream would be
realised&mdash;the giving his life to save Geneva. If he
wished to escape from the cruelties of the princes
which threatened him on every side, he must sink
himself, retire, give up his noblest plans: he shrank
with horror from the thought. To resist the conspiracy
directed against the liberties of Geneva was
his duty; if he neglected to discharge it, he would
degrade himself in his own eyes, he would expose
himself to remorse; while if he accomplished this
task, he would feel himself in his proper place; it
seemed to him that he would become better and more
acceptable to God. But it was not only imperious,
invincible duty which impelled him: it was passion,
the noblest of passions; nothing could calm the tempests
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
struggling in his bosom. He therefore threw
himself energetically into the midst of dangers. In
vain did Bonivard show symptoms of discouragement,
and say to his generous friend in their meetings at St.
Victor: ‘You see the pensions and threats of the prince
are inducing many reputed sensible men to <i>draw in
their horns</i>.’ Bonivard could not check Berthelier’s
decision. Caring for nothing, not even for his life,
provided he saved the liberties of Geneva, the intrepid
citizen went through the city, visiting from house to
house, remonstrating with the citizens ‘one by one;’
exhorting them in private.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a></p>

<p>His exhortations were not unavailing: a strong
fermentation began to stir men’s minds. They called
to remembrance how these Swiss, from whom they
expected deliverance, had conquered their liberty.
A hat set up in Altorf on the top of a pole; an apple
placed by a cruel order on the head of a child: were,
according to the old traditions of that people, the signal
of their independence. Was the bastard less tyrannous
than Gessler? Those two heads, those two arms,&mdash;were
they not a still more frightful signal? The
remains of Navis and of Blanchet were long left
exposed: in vain did the unhappy father, judge Navis,
address frequent and earnest appeals to the bishop to
have them removed; the prelate took delight in this
demonstration of his power.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> It was a strange blindness
on his part. Those dead limbs, those closed
eyes, those blood-stained lips preached to the citizens
that it was time to defend their ancient liberties....
The great agitator took advantage of the bastard’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
cruelty, and employing the energetic language of the
times, he said: ‘The same pin hangs on the cloak
of every one of us. We must resist. Let us unite,
let us give our hand to the League, and fear nothing,
for nobody dares touch their allies ... any more
than St. Anthony’s fire.<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a> ... Let us help ourselves,
and God will help us.’</p>

<p>The young, the poor, all generous hearts listened
to Berthelier’s words; ‘but the great and the rich,’
says Bonivard, ‘were afraid on account of their riches
which they preferred to their life.’<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> These great and
rich folk, Montyon and the ducal faction, seeing the
dangers that threatened the princes of Savoy in
Geneva, resolved to send a second embassy with
orders to go this time even to Turin and Pignerol.
The same three mamelukes were intrusted with the
mission. The patriots were indignant: ‘What!’ they
said, ‘you want to save the sheep, and yet select
wolves to do it?’&mdash;‘Do you not understand,’ replied
Montyon, ‘that if you wish to <i>tame</i> princes, you must
take care not to send men who are disagreeable to
them?’ The deputation arrived at Turin, where the
duke then was. They demanded an audience to present
their homage to his Highness, and as their
sentiments were known, their prayer was easily
granted. They timidly stated their grievances. ‘It
was not I who did it,’ said Charles; ‘it was my lord
of Geneva; go to the bishop at Pignerol.’ The
deputation proceeded to this town, situated in the
neighbourhood of the schismatic Waldenses, whom
the prelate hated as much at least as he did the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
Genevans. Having obtained an audience, they repeated
the lesson they had been taught: ‘The city is
much astonished that you have put two of our citizens
to death and sent their quarters to the frontiers of
Geneva. If any private individuals had offended
against you, say our citizens, you had only to accuse
them, they would have been punished at Geneva.’<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a>&mdash;‘It
was not I who did that,’ said the bishop, ‘it was
my lord the duke.’ The mameluke deputies were
strongly inclined to admit one half of the assertion
of the two princes, and to believe that probably the
murder came neither from John nor Charles. The
official mission being ended, the prelate, who knew
well with whom he had to deal, gave directions for
the ambassadors to be entertained. The latter desired
nothing better. The bishop ‘accordingly entertained
them,’ say the chronicles, ‘treated, feasted, and made
merry with them.’ Pleasure parties followed each
other rapidly, and the three mamelukes, forgetting
their diplomatic business, found the wines of Italy
excellent, and the bastard and his court quite captivating.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a></p>

<p>All good cheer however comes to an end: the politicians
of the court of Turin wished to profit by the
embassy, and, although it had been directed against
the usurpations of the princes of Savoy, to turn it
skilfully against the liberties of the people of Geneva.
This was not difficult, for their representatives were
betraying them. The three ambassadors, the bishop,
his officers, and the ducal councillors deliberated
on the answer to be sent to the council of Geneva.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
The princes, trusting in their pensioners, despised the
liberal party; but the three envoys, the vidame, Nergaz,
and D&eacute;l&eacute;amont, who had seen the danger closely,
far from doing the same, were alarmed at this carelessness.
‘There are loyal subjects in Geneva,’ they said;
‘but there are also rascals, rebels and plotters who,
in order to escape the punishment of their misdeeds,
urge the people to contract an alliance with Friburg.
The evil is greater than you imagine; the Helvetic
republics will establish their accursed popular government
in Geneva. You must therefore punish very
sharply the advisers of such matters, and crush the
rebels.’<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a> The two cousins desired nothing better.
Charles had no wish to see liberal principles come
nearer to Savoy and perhaps to Turin; but he preferred
making only a verbal answer to the council. The
deputies, alarmed at the responsibility thus laid upon
them, insisted on a written answer, and a letter was
accordingly drawn up. In it the duke and the bishop
informed the council ‘that they would hold them loyal
subjects if they would assist in <i>unhesitatingly putting
to death Berthelier and ten or twelve others</i>,’ whom they
named. ‘We hand you this letter,’ said the duke and
the bishop to the deputies; ‘but you will not deliver
it to the syndics and council of Geneva unless they
promise on their oaths (before reading it) to execute
without delay the orders it contains.’ Never had
monarch put forward such enormous pretensions.
God first disorders in mind those whom He intends
to ruin. The servile ambassadors took care to make
no objections, and delighted with the success of
their embassy and particularly with the brilliant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
f&ecirc;tes of the court of Turin, they departed with the
strange instructions which the two princes had given
them.<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a></p>

<p>While the mamelukes and Savoyards were conspiring
at Turin and Pignerol against the liberties of the
city, Berthelier and his friends were thinking how to
preserve them. The iniquity of the duke and the bishop
showed them more and more every day the necessity of
independence. They resolved to take a decisive step.
Berthelier, Bernard, Bonivard, L&eacute;vrier, Vandel, De la
Mare, Besan&ccedil;on Hugues, and some others met in consultation.
‘Hitherto,’ said Berthelier, ‘it is only in
parlours and closets that we have advised an alliance
with the Swiss; we must now proclaim it on the
house-tops; simple conversations are no longer enough:
it is time to come to a common decision. But alas!
where, when, and how?... The princes of Savoy have
accustomed us to assemble only for our pleasures.
Who ever thinks in our meetings of the safety of the
city?’ Bonivard then began to speak: ‘The house
of M. de Gingins and mine at St. Victor have often
seen us assembled in small numbers for familiar conversation.
We now require larger rooms and more
numerous meetings. This is my proposition. Let us
employ to do good the same means as we have hitherto
used to do evil. Let us take advantage of the meetings
where until now nothing was thought of but pleasure,
to deliberate henceforth on the maintenance of our
liberties.’ This proposition met with a favourable
reception.</p>

<p>Since the murder of Blanchet and Navis, it had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
become more difficult to hold these huguenot meetings.
The threats of Savoy were such that men were
afraid of everything that might give an excuse for
violent measures. ‘There was in former times at
Geneva,’ observed one of the company, ‘a brotherhood
of St. George which is now degenerated but not
destroyed; let us revive it and make use of it; let us
employ it to save the franchises threatened by the
Savoy princes.’<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a></p>

<p>Berthelier set to work as soon as the meeting broke
up. When he desired to assemble his friends, he used
to pass whistling under their windows. He began to
saunter through the streets with a look of unconcern,
but with his eyes on the watch, and gave a whistle
whenever he passed the house of a devoted citizen.
The huguenots listened, recognised the signal of their
chief, came out, and went up to him: a meeting was
appointed for a certain day and hour.</p>

<p>The day arrived. ‘We were about sixty,’ said
Bonivard. It was not a large number, but they
were all men of spirit and enterprise. It was no
meeting of conspirators: the worthiest members of the
republic had assembled, who had no intention to go
beyond the rights which the constitution gave them.
In fact Berthelier and Besan&ccedil;on Hugues proposed
simply an alliance with the Swiss. ‘This thought is
not a fancy sprung from an empty brain,’ they said;
‘the princes of Savoy force us to it. By taking
away our fairs, by trampling the laws under foot, by
breaking off our relations with other countries, they
compel us to unite with the Swiss.’ When they found
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
Savoy violently breaking the branches of the tree,
and even trying to uproot it, these patriots were determined
to graft it on the old and more vigorous stock
of Helvetic liberty.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a></p>

<p>The rumour of this decision, which they tried however
to keep secret, reached Turin. Nothing in the
world could cause more anger and alarm to the bishop
and the duke. They answered immediately, on the 13th
of October, by sending an order to bring Berthelier
to trial in the following month before the episcopal
commissioners; this was delivering him to death.
Councillor Marti of Friburg, a blunt man, but also
intelligent, warm, devoted and ready, being informed
of what was going on, hastened to Geneva. The most
sacred friendship had been formed between him and
Berthelier when, seated at the same hearth, they had
conversed together about Geneva and liberty. The
thought that a violent death might suddenly carry
off a man so dear, disturbed Marti seriously. He
proceeded to the h&ocirc;tel-de-ville, where the Council
of Fifty had met, and showed at once how full
he was of tenderness for Berthelier, and of anger
for his enemies. ‘Sirs,’ he said bluntly, ‘this is the
fifth time I have come here about the same business:
I beg that it may be the last. Protect Berthelier as
the liberties of your city require, or beware! Friburg
has always desired your good; do not oblige us to
change our opinion.... Do not halt between two
sides: decide for one or the other. The duke and
the bishop say one thing, and they always do another:
they think only of destroying your liberties, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
Friburg of defending them.’ The council, who found
it more convenient to give the right hand to one
and the left to another, to keep on good terms with
Friburg and the bishop, thought this speech a little
rude. They thanked Marti all the same, but added
that, before giving a decisive answer, they must wait
the return of the deputies sent to the bishop and the
duke. ‘Nevertheless,’ added the syndics, ‘as regards
Berthelier we will maintain the liberties of the
city.’<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a></p>

<p>The deputies whom they expected from Turin&mdash;Nergaz,
D&eacute;l&eacute;amont, and the vidame&mdash;soon arrived.
When they returned to the free city, they were still
dazzled by the pomp of the Piedmontese court, and
filled with the ideas which the partisans of absolute
power had instilled into them. ‘Everything is in the
prince,’ they had said, ‘and the people ought to have
no other will but his.’ Thinking only of claiming
absolute authority for the bishop, they appeared on the
29th of November before the Council of State, and
said in an imperative tone: ‘We have orders from
my lord bishop not to discharge our mission until
you have added to your number twenty of the most
eminent citizens.’ In this way the princes of Savoy
wished to make sure of a majority. The council
assented to this demand. ‘We require them,’ added
Syndic Nergaz, ‘to make oath in our presence that
they will reveal nothing they may hear.’&mdash;‘What
means all this mystery?’ the councillors asked each
other; but the oath was taken. The ambassadors
then advanced another step: ‘Here is the letter in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
which my lord makes known his sovereign will; but
before it is opened, you must all swear to execute the
orders it contains.’ This strange demand was received
in sullen silence; such open despotism astonished not
only the friends of liberty but even the mamelukes.
‘Hand us the letter addressed to us, that we may
read it,’ said Besan&ccedil;on Hugues and other independent
members of the council. ‘No,’ replied Nergaz, ‘the
oath first, and then the letter.’ Some partisans of
Savoy had the impudence to second this demand;
but ‘the friends of independence’ resisted firmly, and
the meeting broke up. ‘There must be some secret
in that letter dangerous to the people,’ they said.
It was resolved to convene the general council in
order that the ambassadors might deliver their message
in person. This appeal to the people was very
disagreeable to the three deputies; yet they encouraged
one another to carry out their mission to the end.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a></p>

<p>On Sunday, December 5, the sound of a trumpet
was heard, the great bell of the cathedral tolled, the
citizens put on their swords, and the large hall of Rive
was ‘quite filled with people.’ The deputies were
desired to ‘deliver their message.’&mdash;‘Our message is
found in the letter,’ said Nergaz, ‘and our only instructions
are that before the council of Geneva open
it, they shall swear to carry out its orders.’ These
words caused an immense agitation among the people.
‘We have so good a leader,’ said they with irony, ‘that
we ought to follow him with our eyes shut and not
fear to fall into the ditch with him! How can we
doubt that the secret contained in this mysterious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
paper is a secret of justice and love?... If there
are any sceptics among us, let them go to the walnut-tree
at the bridge of Arve, where the limbs of our
friends are still hanging.’&mdash;‘Gentlemen,’ said the
more serious men, ‘we return you the letter unopened,
and beg you will send it back to those who gave it
you.’ Then Nergaz, feeling annoyed, exclaimed bitterly:
‘I warn you that my lord of Savoy has many
troops in the field, and that if you do not execute
the orders contained in this letter, no citizen of Geneva
will be safe in his states. I heard him say so.’ The
people on hearing this were much exasperated. ‘Indeed!’
they exclaimed, ‘if we do not swear beforehand
to do a thing without knowing it, all who possess
lands in Savoy or who travel there, will be treated
like Navis and Blanchet.’ ... Thereupon several
citizens turned to the three deputies and said: ‘Have
you remained five or six weeks over the mountains,
feasting, amusing yourselves, exulting, and living
merrily, in order to bring us such despatches? To the
Rhone with the traitors! to the Rhone! The three
mamelukes trembled before the anger of the people.
Were they really to be flung into the river to be
cleansed from the impurities they had contracted in
the f&ecirc;tes at Turin?... L&eacute;vrier, Besan&ccedil;on Hugues,
and other men of condition quieted the citizens, and
the servile deputies got off with their fright. Calm
being restored, the councillors returned the prince’s
letter to Nergaz and his colleagues, saying: ‘We will
not open it.’ They feared the influence of the
creatures of Savoy, of whom there were many in the
Great Council. We give this name to the body
established in 1457, which consisted at first of only
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
fifty persons, and which being frequently increased
became somewhat later the Council of Two Hundred.
The people withdrew from this assembly a privilege
they had given it in 1502, and decreed that the
general council alone should henceforward decide on
all that concerned the liberties of Geneva.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a>

<span class="small">THE HUGUENOTS DEMAND AN ALLIANCE WITH FRIBURG: THE
MAMELUKES OPPOSE IT. BERTHELIER IS ACQUITTED.<br />

(<span class="smcap">December 1518 to January 1519.</span>)</span></h2>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> cruel butchery of Navis and Blanchet, and
the insolent sealed letter, were acts ruinous to
those who had committed them. If the bishop had
possessed only the spiritual power, he would not have
been dragged into such measures; but by wishing
to unite earthly dominion with religious direction,
he lost both: a just punishment of those who forget
the words of Christ: ‘My kingdom is not of this
world.’ The bishop had torn the contract that bound
him to the free citizens of the ancient city. The
struggle was growing fiercer every day, and would
infallibly end in the fall of the Roman episcopate in
Geneva. It was not the Reformation that was to
overthrow the representative of the pope: it was the
breath of liberty and legality that was to uproot that
barren tree, and the reformers were to come afterwards
to cultivate the soil and scatter abroad the
seeds of life. Two parties, both strangers to the
Gospel, stood then face to face. On the one side were
the bishop, the vicar and procurator-fiscal, the canons,
priests, monks, and all the agents of the popedom; on
the other were the friends of light, the friends of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
liberty, the partisans of law, the representatives of the
people. The battle was between clerical and secular
society. These struggles were not new; but while in
the middle ages clerical society had always gained the
victory, at Geneva, on the contrary, in the sixteenth
century the series of its defeats was to begin. It is
easy to explain this phenomenon. Ecclesiastical society
had long been the most advanced as well as the
strongest; but in the sixteenth century secular society
appeared in all the vigour of youth, and was soon to
gain the victories of a maturer age. It was all
over with the clerical power: the weapons it employed
at Geneva (the letter and the walnut-tree)
indicated a thorough decline of human dignity. Out
of date, fallen into childishness, and decrepid, it could
no longer contend against the lay body. If the duel
took place on open ground, without secret understandings,
without trickery, the dishonoured clerical
authority must necessarily fall. The Epicurean hog
(if we may be permitted to use an ancient phrase), at
once filthy and cruel, who from his episcopal throne
trampled brutally under foot the holiest rights, was
unconsciously preparing in Geneva the glorious advent
of the Reformation.</p>

<p>The meeting of the 5th of December was no sooner
dissolved than the citizens dispersed through the town.
The insolent request of the princes and the refusal of
the people were the subject of every conversation:
nothing else was talked of ‘in public or in private, at
feast or funeral.’ The letter which demanded on
behalf of Geneva an alliance with Friburg was not
sealed like the bishop’s; it was openly displayed in the
streets, and carried from house to house; a large number
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
of citizens hastened to subscribe their names: there were
three hundred signatures. It was necessary to carry
this petition to Friburg; Berthelier, who was still
under trial, could not leave the city; besides, it would
be better to have a new man, more calm perhaps,
and more diplomatic. They cast their eyes on the
syndic Besan&ccedil;on Hugues, who in character held a
certain mean between Berthelier the man of action,
and L&eacute;vrier the man of law. ‘No one can be more
welcome among the confederates than you,’ they said;
‘Conrad Hugues, your father, fought at Morat in the
ranks of Zurich.’&mdash;‘I will go,’ he replied, ‘but as a
mere citizen.’ They wished to give him a colleague
of a more genial nature, and chose De la Mare. He
had resided for some time on a property his wife
possessed in Savoy; but the gentry of the neighbourhood
‘playing him many tricks,’ because he was
a Genevan, he had returned to the city burning with
hatred against the Savoyard dominion.</p>

<p>The two deputies met with a warm reception and
great honour at Friburg. The pensioners of Savoy
opposed their demand in vain; the three hundred
Genevans who had signed the petition received the
freedom of the city, with an offer to make the
alliance general if the community desired it. On
Tuesday, December 21, the two deputies returned
to Geneva, and on the following Thursday the proposal
of alliance was brought before the people in
general council. It was to be a great day; and accordingly
the two parties went to the council determined,
each of them, to make a last effort. The
partisans of absolutism and those of the civic liberties,
the citizens attached to Rome and those who were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
inclined to throw off their chains, the old times and the
new, met face to face. At first there were several
eloquent speeches on both sides: ‘We will not permit
law and liberty to be driven out of Geneva,’ said the
citizens, ‘in order that arbitrary rule may be set up in
their place. God himself is the guarantee of our franchises.’
They soon came to warmer language, and
at last grew so excited that deliberation was impossible.
The deputy from Friburg, who had returned with
Hugues and De la Mare, strove in vain to calm their
minds; the council was compelled to separate without
coming to any decision. Switzerland had offered her
alliance, and Geneva had not accepted it.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a></p>

<p>The friends of independence were uneasy; most
of them were deficient in information and in arguments;
they supplied the want by the instinct of
liberty, boldness, and enthusiasm; but these are qualities
that sometimes fail and fade away. Many of
them accordingly feared that the liberties of Geneva
would be finally sacrificed to the bishop’s good pleasure.
The more enlightened thought, on the contrary,
that the rights of the citizens would remain
secure; that neither privilege, stratagem, nor violence
would overthrow them; but that the struggle might
perhaps be long, and if, according to the proverb,
Rome was not built in a day, so it could not be
thrown down in a day. These notable men, whose
motto was ‘Time brings everything,’ called upon
the people to be patient. This was not what the
ardent Berthelier wanted. He desired to act immediately,
and seeing that the best-informed men
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
hesitated, he said: ‘When the wise will not, we make
use of fools.’ He had again recourse to the young
Genevans, with whom he had long associated, with a
view of winning them over to his patriotic plans. He
was not alone. Another citizen now comes upon the
scene, a member of one of the most influential families
in the city, by name Baudichon de la Maison-Neuve,
a man of noble and exalted character, bold, welcome
everywhere, braving without measure all the traditions
of old times, often turbulent, and the person who,
more perhaps than any other, served to clear in Geneva
the way by which the Reformation was to enter.
These two patriots and some of their friends endeavoured
to revive in the people the remembrance of
their ancient rights. At the banquets where the young
men of Geneva assembled, epigrams were launched
against the ducal party, civic and Helvetic songs were
sung, and among others one composed by Berthelier,
the unpoetical but very patriotic burden of which was:

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Vivent sur tous, Messieurs les alli&eacute;s!<br /></span>
</span></span>

Every day this chorus was heard with fresh enthusiasm.
The wind blew in the direction of independence,
and the popular waves continued rising.
‘Most of the city are joining our brotherhood,’ said
Bonivard; ‘decidedly the townsfolk are the strongest.’
The Christmas holidays favoured the exultation of
the citizens. The most hot-headed of the Genevan
youths paraded the streets; at night they kindled
bonfires in the squares (which they called <i>ardre des
failles</i>), and the boys, making torches of twisted
straw, ran up and down the city, shouting: ‘Hurrah
for the League! the huguenots for ever!’ Armed men
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
kept watch throughout the city, and as they passed
the houses of the mamelukes, they launched their
gibes at them. ‘They were very merry,’ said Bonivard,
‘and made more noise than was necessary.’
The two parties became more distinct every day, the
huguenots wearing a cross on their doublets and a
feather in their caps, like the Swiss; the mamelukes
carrying a sprig of holly on their head. ‘Whoever
touches me will be pricked,’ said they, insolently
pointing to it. Quarrels were frequent. When a
band of the friends of Savoy happened to meet a
number of the friends of the League, the former
would cry out: ‘Huguenots!’ and the latter would
reply: ‘We hold that title in honour, for it was taken
by the first Swiss when they bound themselves by an
oath against the tyranny of their oppressors!... But
you mamelukes have always been slaves!’&mdash;‘Beware,’
said the vidame, ‘your proceedings are seditious.’&mdash;‘The
necessity of escaping from slavery makes them
lawful,’ replied Berthelier, Maison-Neuve, and their
followers. The mountain torrent was rushing impetuously
down, and men asked whether the dykes
raised against it would be able to restrain its
fury.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a></p>

<p>The party of Savoy resolved to strike a decisive
blow. No one was more threatened than Berthelier.
The two princes might perhaps have spared the lives
of the other citizens whose names were contained in the
letter; but as for Berthelier, they must have his head,
and that speedily. This was generally known: people
feared to compromise themselves by saluting him, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
timid men turned aside when they saw him coming,
which made Bonivard, who remained faithful to him,
exclaim with uneasiness: ‘Alas! he is abandoned by
almost everybody of condition!’ But Berthelier did
not abandon himself. He saw the sword hanging
over his head; he knew that the blow was coming,
and yet he was the most serene and animated of the
citizens of Geneva; it was he who ‘by word and by
example always comforted the young men.’ He asked
simply that <i>right should be done</i>. ‘I am accused of
being a marplot because I ask for justice;&mdash;a good-for-nothing,
because I defend liberty against the enterprises
of usurpers;&mdash;a conspirator against the bishop’s
life, because they conspire against mine.’ His
case was adjourned week after week. His friends,
touched by the serenity of his generous soul, loudly
demanded a general council. The people assembled on
the 19th of January: ‘All that I ask,’ said Berthelier,
‘is to be brought to trial; let them punish me if I
am guilty; and if I am innocent, let them declare it.’
The general council ordered the syndics to do justice.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a></p>

<p>They hesitated no longer: they carefully examined
the indictment; they summoned the vidame and the
procurator-fiscal three times to make out their
charges. The vidame, knowing this to be impossible,
got out of the way: he could not be found.
Navis appeared alone, but only to declare that he
would give no evidence. All the formalities having
been observed, the Grand Council, consisting at that
time of 117 members, met on the 24th of January,
1519, and delivered a judgment of acquittal. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
syndics, bearing their rods of office and followed by
all the members of the council, took their station (according
to the ancient custom) on the platform in front
of the h&ocirc;tel-de-ville. An immense crowd of citizens
gathered round; many were clinging to the walls;
all fixed their eyes with enthusiasm on the accused
who stood calm and firm before his judges. Then
Montyon, the premier syndic, a mameluke yet a faithful
observer of the law, said to him: ‘Philibert Berthelier,
the accusations brought against you proceeding, not
from probable evidence but from violent and extorted
confessions, condemned by all law human and divine.
We, the syndics and judges in the criminal courts of
this city of Geneva, having God and the Holy Scriptures
before our eyes,&mdash;making the sign of the cross
and speaking in the name of the Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost,&mdash;declare you, Philibert, by our definitive
sentence, to be in no degree attaint or guilty of the
crime of conspiring against our prince and yours, and
declare the accusations brought against you unreasonable
and unjust. Wherefore you ought to be absolved
and acquitted of these, and you are hereby
absolved and acquitted.’ This judgment, delivered
by a magistrate devoted to the duke and the bishop,
was a noble homage paid to the justice of the cause
defended by Berthelier. A solemn feeling, such as
accompanies a great and just deliverance, pervaded
the assembly, and the joyful patriots asked if Berthelier’s
acquittal was not the pledge of the liberation
of Geneva.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span></p>

<p>But if the joy among the huguenots was great, the
consternation of the mamelukes was greater still.
This <i>mystery</i>&mdash;for such they called the acquittal of
an innocent man&mdash;terrified them. They had fancied
their affairs in a better position, and all of a sudden
they appeared desperate. That noble head, which
they desired to bring low, now rose calm and cheerful
in the midst of an enthusiastic people. To complete
their misfortune, it was one of their own party that
had delivered that abominable verdict of acquittal.
They sent the news to their friends in Piedmont,
adding that their affairs had never been in a worse
position. Berthelier’s acquittal created a deep sensation
at the court of Turin. It was a triumph of law
and liberty that compromised all the plans of Savoy.
By seizing Berthelier, they had hoped to extinguish
that fire of independence and liberty, which they
could discern afar on the Genevan hills; and now
the fire which they hoped had been stifled, was
shooting out a brighter and a higher flame.... The
Archbishop of Turin, who had sworn to destroy all
republican independence, represented to his sovereign
the true meaning of the sentence that had just
been delivered. The feeble duke, who knew not
how to carry out his enterprises and feared spending
money more than losing his dominions, had remained
until this moment in a state of foolish confidence. He
now awoke: he saw that the alliance with Switzerland
would deprive him of Geneva for ever, and considered
Berthelier’s acquittal as an outrage upon his honour.
He determined to break the alliance, to quash the
judgment, and to employ, if necessary, all the force
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
of Savoy. He began, however, with diplomatic
measures.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a></p>

<p>On the 30th of January his ambassadors, the president
of Landes, the seignior of Balayson, Bernard of
St. Germain, and the skilful and energetic Saleneuve,
arrived in Geneva, and, having been introduced to the
general council, made at first loud protestations of
friendship. But soon changing their tone and wishing
to terrify by their threats, they said: ‘Nevertheless
his Highness learns that some of you are
conspiring against him.’ At these words there was
a great commotion in the assembly: ‘Who are the
conspirators? name them,’ was the cry from every
side. The seignior of Landes, who had let the word
escape him, corrected himself, and assured them that
the duke was delighted to hear that the people had
refused to favour those who were opposed to him.
But the ambassador changed his tone to no purpose&mdash;the
Genevan susceptibility was roused: that unlucky
word <i>conspire</i> spread through the city. ‘To
conspire against the duke he must first be our prince,’
said some. ‘Now, whatever he may say, he is only
<i>vidame</i>, that is, a civil officer, and as such subordinate
to the supreme council. We will make no reply to
the ambassadors of Savoy so long as they do not
name the conspirators.’ The Savoyards increased
their attentions, and showed the tenderest regard for
the purses of the Genevans. ‘We are quite alarmed,’
they said, ‘at the quantity of gold florins you will
have to pay Friburg for its alliance.’ They carefully
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
hid themselves under sheep’s clothing; but do
what they would, the wolf’s fangs peeped out unexpectedly
now and then; and while the chiefs were
enshrouding themselves in diplomacy, sharp disputes
occurred between the citizens and the ambassadors’
attendants. ‘All the Genevans are traitors!’ exclaimed
a servant belonging to the treasury of
Chamb&eacute;ry. The varlet was reprimanded, but the
ambassadors thought it prudent to leave the city.
They were exasperated, and on their return to Turin
told the duke: ‘You will gain nothing by reasoning
with these citizens. If you say you are their prince,
they will maintain that you are their vassal.’&mdash;‘Well,
then,’ said the duke, ‘let us settle the matter not with
the pen but with the sword.’ That was just what the
energetic Saleneuve desired.<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a>

<span class="small">THE PEOPLE IN GENERAL COUNCIL VOTE FOR THE ALLIANCE.
THE DUKE INTRIGUES AGAINST IT.<br />

(<span class="smcap">February and March 1519.</span>)</span></h2>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> Genevans knew what sort of report would be
made of them at Turin; they therefore resolved
to forestall the duke and to conclude as soon as possible
an alliance with the Swiss, which would permit
them vigorously to repel the Savoyards. Nothing
could be more lawful. Liberty was of old date in
Geneva: the despotism of the princes was an innovation.
The people having met according to custom on
Sunday, February 6, 1519, to elect the four syndics for
the year, Besan&ccedil;on Hugues came forward. At first
he seemed to be speaking in personal explanation,
but one only thought filled his heart&mdash;he wished to
see Geneva united to Switzerland. To propose this
openly would endanger his life, and perhaps give an
advantage to the enemy; he therefore proceeded
artfully to work. ‘Sovereign lords,’ said he, ‘the
ambassadors of Savoy spoke of conspirators; I
think they meant me, and had my journey to
Friburg in their mind. Now, I declare that I have
done nothing contrary to the duty of a citizen....
Besides,’ added he, as if parenthetically, ‘if you desire
to know all about it, you will find it explained at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
length in a letter from the council of Friburg.’&mdash;‘The
letter, read the letter,’ they cried out. This was just
what Hugues wanted: Friburg would thus make the
proposal which he dared not bring forward himself.
The letter was read before all the assembly. ‘When
it shall please the entire community of Geneva to join
in friendship and citizenship with the people of Friburg,’
said the writer, ‘the latter will agree cheerfully,
without prejudice either to the rights of the bishop
and prince of Geneva, or to the liberties and franchises
of the city, and neither of the parties shall pay tribute
to the other.’<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a></p>

<p>When they heard this loyal and generous letter,
the people were enraptured. The Swiss themselves
were stretching out their hands to them. The joy
was universal; there was a cry for the offer of these
noble confederates to be put to the vote. Montyon,
the mameluke syndic, was alarmed; he was taken
unawares; that immense affair against which the
bishop and Savoy were uniting their forces was about
to be carried as if by storm. Even the patriotic
Vandel was intimidated, and proposed that they
should proceed immediately to the election of the
syndics conformably to the order of the day. It was
too late. Since the 22nd of December, Berthelier
and his friends had displayed unwearied activity: in
six weeks the huguenot party had made immense
progress. Desire, hope, and joy animated the citizens.
Another feeling, however, was mingled with this enthusiasm,
and it was indignation. The ambassadors
of Savoy had insinuated, it will be remembered, that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
Geneva would have to pay tribute to Friburg.
‘Where are those famous gold florins, with which
they frightened us?’ said the citizens. ‘The duke
who is only a civil officer among us, in his desire
to become prince, condescends to vile falsehoods in
order that he may succeed!’ ... From every quarter
rose the cry: ‘A poll, a poll! citizenship with
Friburg! A poll, a poll!’ As the two first syndics
obstinately refused, Hugues remembered that there are
moments when audacity alone can save a people. He
laid aside his habitual scruples, and acting solely on
his own responsibility, he proposed the alliance. ‘Yes,
yes,’ replied the majority of the assembly with uplifted
hands. A few mamelukes, surprised, disconcerted,
and disheartened, remained silent and still.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a></p>

<p>Thus, at the very moment when the court of Turin
was expressing its discontent at the acquittal of Berthelier,
the people replied by a resolution which
threatened still more the ambitious designs of Savoy.
The citizens of Geneva opened their gates to the
Swiss. By turning their backs on the south, they
forsook despotism and popery; by turning towards
the north, they invited liberty and truth.</p>

<p>The nomination of the syndics, which came next,
seemed to confirm this solemn vote: it was the most
huguenot election ever known. Three of the new
syndics were devoted partisans of independence,
namely, Stephen de la Mare, a connection of the
Gingins, who had accompanied Hugues to Friburg;
John Baud, Hugues’ brother-in-law; and Louis
Plongeon, seignior of Bellerive. Guiges Pr&eacute;vost, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
premier syndic, had indeed very close relations with the
ducal party, but he was a man of good intentions. Many
old councillors had to make way for devoted patriots.
Geneva was beginning to soar: it desired to be free.
Ambassadors set off immediately to announce to
Friburg that the people had voted the alliance.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a></p>

<p>Then burst forth one of those great transports that
come over a whole nation, when after many struggles
it catches a glimpse of liberty. In all the city there
were bonfires, cheering, songs, processions, and banquets.
But here and there, in the midst of this great
joy, there were gloomy faces to be seen; the mamelukes
strove in vain to keep down their anger; it
broke out suddenly in insults and riots. The reaction
was indeed prompt: in the presence of the simple joy
of the people, the duke’s friends drew closer together,
and their party was organised. The house of Savoy
had still many adherents in Geneva, capable of opposing
the desire for independence and truth. There
were old Savoyard families devoted to the duke; persons
who were sold to him; young men of birth,
enthusiasts of absolute power; priests and laymen
enamoured of Rome; traders averse to a war that
would injure their business; weak men, trembling at
the least commotion, and many low people without occupation,
who are easily excited to riot. The party felt
the necessity of calculating their strength and coming
to some understanding; but it was not its most prominent
leaders who placed themselves in the front.
Francis Cartelier, a native of Bresse, and syndic in 1516,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
a lettered, prudent, and cunning but mean man, convened
its principal members in a room at the convent
of Rive, which was called ‘the little stove.’ Thither
came in succession, besides Montyon and Nergaz, whom
we know already, other mamelukes young and full of
zeal: Messieurs de Brandis, who were at the head of
Genevan society; the two De Fernex, who derived
their name from a lordship which became famous in
after years; Marin de Versonex, whose family was
distinguished by its good works, a young man of
limited understanding but ardent imagination, of a
disposition easily led away, and passionately devoted
to the Church of Rome, which alone he thought able
to save him; by his side was his cousin Percival de
Pesmes, united to him by a sincere friendship, and
whose ancestors had been among the crusading barons
who followed St. Louis; lastly, many other noble mamelukes,
determined to oppose even to death the triumph
of the party of liberty and Switzerland. These old
magistrates and these young nobles found themselves
out of their element in Geneva. Sincere for the most
part in their convictions, they believed they saw in
the new day that was rising over the world, a day
of tempest which destroying what existed would put
nothing in its place. What must be done to avert
so dire a misfortune? They resolved to inform the
duke of the alliance which had just been voted, and
urge him to make every exertion to prevent its being
carried out.<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a></p>

<p>All these efforts were to prove useless. Liberty
was beginning to raise her head in one of the smallest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
but most ancient cities of the Empire and the Church.
It is a strange thing that the city bearing on its
flag the symbols of these two absolute powers&mdash;the
key of the popes and the eagle of the emperors&mdash;raised
this very significant banner, and thus proclaimed,
as if in a spirit of contradiction, liberty
in Church and State. While other nations (if we
except the Swiss League) were sleeping under the
feudal sceptre of their masters, this little republic in
the centre of Europe was awaking. Like a dead man
lying in a vast cemetery, it began to stir and alone
came forth triumphant from its tomb. In all the
neighbouring countries, in Switzerland, Savoy, France,
and places more remote, people talked of the strange
movements taking place at Geneva, and of the daring
resistance opposed by a few energetic citizens to a
prince who was brother-in-law to Charles V. and
uncle to Francis I. Men of the old times grew
alarmed. True, it was but a cloud, small as a man’s
hand, but it might grow into a fierce tempest in which
the two ancient buttresses of feudal and Roman
society&mdash;absolute power in spiritual and in temporal
matters&mdash;might be shattered. What would happen
then? Might not this emancipatory movement extend
through Europe? At Geneva men talked of political
liberty; at Wittemberg of religious reform: if these
two streams should chance to unite, they would make
a formidable torrent which would throw down the
edifice of the dark ages and sweep away its ruins into
the great abyss. ‘People spoke everywhere,’ Bonivard
tells us, ‘of huguenots and mamelukes, as they
once did of Guelfs and Ghibelines.’ The prior of St.
Victor, to whom these things were reported, reflected
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
on them and said in his musings: ‘Geneva is beginning
to be a member in the body of christendom
of which strange things are said.’ In examining
them, however, he thought there was room for abatement
both of hopes and fears:&mdash;‘Fame, as Virgil sings,
is a goddess who makes things greater than they are.’<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a>
These things were greater than Bonivard thought.
Geneva, by setting out in search of liberty, was to
find the Gospel.</p>

<p>The duke, the count, and the bishop, informed successively
by their ambassadors, the vidame, and lastly
by the mamelukes of ‘the little stove,’ ‘drank of these
bitter waters’ and asked themselves if they were going
to lose that city from which the house of Savoy had
derived such great profit for centuries. They began
to understand the imprudence of their rough policy;
they began to regret the arrests and the murders;
they would have liked that ‘the work was to be done
over again.’ That seemed difficult; yet after many conferences,
the three princes agreed upon certain plans,
one or other of which they thought must succeed.</p>

<p>First: They sought to break the alliance by means
of their pensioners at Friburg. The latter wishing to
earn their money began to intrigue, to declaim, and to
discuss. But the Friburgers, devoted to the cause of
Geneva and liberty, resisted them, and the people, discovering
the intrigues of the pensioners, rose against
them. There were great disturbances in the streets, and
blows were exchanged. ‘What! does even Friburg
take side with the new ideas?’ people said at the court
of Turin. It was not because they were new, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
because they were old, that Friburg adopted them. The
pensioners of Savoy were obliged to strike their sails,
and they wrote to the duke: ‘All who do not dance to
the tune the people play, incur the risk of a beating.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a> ...
Will your Highness pray excuse us?’</p>

<p>This attempt having failed, the court of Turin
passed to another, and endeavoured to win over the
leaders of the opposition in Geneva. ‘They open
their mouths very wide,’ said the Savoyards; ‘stuff
them with gold.’ Much skill was required to carry
out this new manœuvre. The Bishop of Maurienne,
precentor of the cathedral of Geneva, a supple,
able, insinuating man, and tolerably esteemed by the
friends of liberty, was selected by the duke for this
delicate mission. The prince declared to him with
the strongest oaths (in order that it might be repeated)
that he had nothing to do with the deaths of Navis
and Blanchet. ‘It was done by my lord of Geneva
alone without my knowledge,’ said he. ‘Ah, I should
be very glad it had never happened, let it cost me ever
so much. Repeat all I say to Berthelier. Offer him
gold and silver; in a word, do anything to attach him
to my service.’ Maurienne arrived in Geneva. Nobody
doubted at that time that every man had his
price. ‘His Highness,’ said the bishop to Berthelier,
‘is aware that the crimes of which you are accused
are the inventions of your enemies.’ Then came promises
of gold and silver. ‘Only,’ added Maurienne,
‘let Geneva renounce her alliance with the Swiss.’
Berthelier, who awaited with unflinching heart the
hour when he would pour out his life for the independence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
of Geneva, smiled disdainfully at these
words; then he shuddered, and putting aside the
gilded yet poisoned cup which Maurienne presented
to him, he answered coldly: ‘A vile interest will
never make us render up an innocent people to the
vengeance of your prince.’ Maurienne, rejected by
Berthelier, ‘frequented every place of meeting,’ says
a manuscript, ‘in order to prevail upon the chief
supporters of the alliance to give it up; but he only
lost his pains.’ All whom he tried to seduce wished
to be free and to join hands with Switzerland.<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a></p>

<p>The duke, seeing that he was labouring in vain,
made one more heroic effort. ‘Well, then,’ he said,
‘let us raise all Switzerland.’ The energetic Saleneuve,
the able Chappuis, and the diplomatic Lambert were
sent as ambassadors from Savoy to the deputies of the
cantons then sitting in diet, and complained bitterly
of Geneva. Would that little city weigh as much in
the balance as the powerful house whose states enclosed
the two sides of the Alps? ‘Friburg,’ said president
Lambert, ‘treats with <i>enclav&eacute;s</i>, without the
consent of the most serene prince in whose states they
are placed.’ This new name given to the Genevans
amused Bonivard greatly. ‘Oh, oh!’ he said; ‘no
longer daring to call us his subjects, for the word is
used up, the duke styles us his <i>enclav&eacute;s</i>!’ This time
Charles III. and his government had taken the right
course. The cantons, offended that Friburg had acted
alone in this matter, desiring to humour the duke,
and not being acquainted with the facts, promised
to exhort ‘certain headstrong and rebellious Genevans
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
to desist from their enterprise.’<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> This little republic,
at the moment of her awakening, found ranged against
her both the neighbouring princes and a large majority
of the cantons. The diet declared in favour
of the duke, and sent the Sieur d’Erlach to Geneva to
support the ducal protest. What could little Geneva
do, when pressed at once by Savoy and Switzerland?
It was as if two ships in full sail should come up in
opposite directions, threatening to crush a frail boat
that floated between them. But the poor little bark
carried a ballast which was its salvation, namely,
liberty and the protection of God. Such vessels, even
if they are run down, come to the surface again sooner
or later. The Friburgers did not desert the cause of
independence, but sent John Fabri to Geneva on their
behalf. The two deputies met almost about the same
time on the shores of the Leman, one bringing peace,
the other war.</p>

<p>The general council having met on the 1st of
March, 1519, the generous Fabri, faithful to a desperate
cause, spoke first, and did not conceal from the
assembly the large majority that had declared against
Geneva. ‘Consider the matter and see for yourselves
what ought to be done,’ he said. ‘As for us, we will
preserve the alliance to the last drop of our blood.’
These words electrified the audience. ‘And we too!’
they shouted all around. The citizens were stirred:
they shook hands, they blessed Friburg and embraced
Fabri: everybody swore to be true to the alliance.
The Friburgers quitted the hall touched with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
noble sight of a nation ready to brave the greatest
dangers in the maintenance of its rights.</p>

<p>The deputy from the League was admitted next.
Cold and diplomatic, a stiff patrician and inflexible
magistrate, D’Erlach spoke with an imperious voice:
‘Obey the duke,’ he said. ‘Be henceforward his faithful
subjects; break off your alliance with Friburg. The
League require it from you under pain of their deep
resentment; and as for Friburg, they command it.’
This short and rough speech amazed the Genevans.
How long had they been the subjects of Savoy?...
Had the Swiss League broken their own yoke only to
impose it on others? Had they lighted the torch of
liberty on their own mountains only to extinguish it
elsewhere?... What! shall the representatives of
the ancient liberties draw up in battle array against
the new liberty? The proudest of the Genevans,
with heads upraised, said haughtily that even the
Swiss could not make them bend. Yet all the citizens
were not so brave. Could Geneva be saved if
Switzerland forsook her? Many became uneasy,
some were grieved: the mamelukes alone rejoiced
and triumphed. The place of assembly reechoed with
weeping, groans, and curses. The confusion continued
to increase.</p>

<p>When the deputy from Berne had withdrawn, the
deputy from Friburg, animated with the most heroic
sentiments, returned to reassure the people; and notwithstanding
the declarations of the Bernese commissioner
he affirmed stoutly that Berne would not
abandon Geneva. ‘Fear nothing,’ he said; ‘my lords of
Berne and Friburg are brothers; they will not quarrel
with each other for the love of Savoy. And though
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
Berne should forsake you, we are strong enough
with God’s help, and we will not permit either you
or ourselves to be trampled on.... Declare frankly
whether you desire the alliance: say Yes or No.’
Then with a loud shout the people exclaimed: ‘Yes!
yes! Better see our wives and children slain, better
die a thousand deaths ourselves, than cancel the
alliance with Friburg!’ The general council desiring
to give an energetic proof of its will, and to make
the resolution irrevocable, decreed that if any should
propose the rupture of the alliance, he should be forthwith
beheaded. The syndics returned to the inn where
D’Erlach coldly awaited their answer. It was as becoming
and proud as D’Erlach’s speech had been
imperious. ‘We will send a deputation to the next
diet,’ they said, ‘when we will prove that we are not
the duke’s subjects, and that we have done nothing to
his prejudice.’<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a></p>

<p>The greatness of a people does not depend upon the
extent of its territory. There was a soul in this little
nation, and in that soul dwelt lofty aspirations. Had
all the powers of the earth risen against Berthelier,
L&eacute;vrier, and Hugues, these energetic men would not
have quailed. At the meeting of the general council
on the following day (March 2, 1519) the alliance was
confirmed; Hugues and Malbuisson started immediately
for Friburg with instructions to sign the engagement,
which the Helvetic diet had just ordered to be
cancelled. Such was the answer made by Geneva to
the Swiss. The faithful devotedness of Friburg should
be for ever inscribed as an example in the records of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
history. But it is not to the Swiss in general, as is
commonly believed, that the Genevans substantially
owe their independence, but to God and to the strong
will that God gave them.<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a>

<span class="small">THE CANONS JOIN THE DUKE, AND THE PEOPLE RISE
AGAINST THEM.<br />

(<span class="smcap">March 1519.</span>)</span></h2>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> duke hesitated no longer. Pacific and diplomatic
means were exhausted; he must now
draw the sword and with its trenchant edge hew
down the pride of Geneva. Nevertheless, to save
appearances, he desired that some influential body
would declare against the alliance; for it would
then seem as if he were supporting a Genevese party,
and his intervention with an armed force would look
less odious. To attain his end he turned his eyes
on the chapter of St. Pierre, the bishop’s natural
council, and in his absence representing the catholic
church. Its members being all noble or graduates in
law (which at that time amounted almost to nobility),
this body might be considered as the house of lords
in the Genevan constitution.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a> The duke instructed
his agents to work upon the canons, and they might
have been seen going from door to door in the street
that still bears their name. They advised the canons
to be on their guard; that this alliance with the Swiss
compromised everything, and particularly their functions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
and benefices. They were conjured to write to
my lords of the League, stating that the chapter did
not assent to the alliance in question. The canons, flattered
by the importance which his Highness of Savoy
attached to their opinion, hastily put on scapulary
and amice and assembled in chapter. The success of
this ducal manœuvre could not be doubtful. Only
one canon was a native of Geneva; and this was
Michael Navis, brother of him whom the bishop had
murdered&mdash;a man as servile as his brother was independent.
Two only were liberals: De Gingins,
abbot of Bonmont, and Bonivard, prior of St. Victor,
who was the youngest of the chapter, and who had
no vote because he was not in holy orders. All the
other canons were devoted to the duke&mdash;all worthy
gentlemen, much impressed with their own dignity,
like those canons of St. John of Lyons who, having
produced their quarterings of nobility, demanded
the privilege of not kneeling at the elevation of the
host. The chapter opened their deliberations; and
‘the stout master-courtiers who had the right to speak
first began to say <i>amen</i>.’ Bonivard, who saw these
fat canons one after another bending low their bloated
faces, grew alarmed at the turn matters were taking.
What would be the consequence if the Church said
No, while the people said Yes? What disorders at
home, what weakness abroad! He saw that the opposition
in the chapter fell to his share; he performed
his duty valiantly and paid dearly for it. He had
not been asked for his vote, and the secretary was
preparing to commit the resolution to writing, when
the prior rose and said: ‘Stop a little, Mr. Secretary,
although I am not <i>in sacris</i> (in orders) and have no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
vote in the chapter, I have a duty here. Now it
seems to me that before granting the illustrious duke
his request, you should consider the purport of it a
little better.<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a> It tends to break off that alliance with
Friburg which the people of this city have so much
at heart that they would lose their wives and children
sooner than renounce it. Think of what you are
doing.... Very reverend sirs, you cannot return an
answer to the duke without that answer being known
to our people with whom you have promised to live
and die. What will they say of you? With your
permission I will tell you. They will say that you
are playing the scorpion’s trick&mdash;that you pretend
to be friends in front, and behind you inflict a mortal
wound with your tail.... Fear their anger. Rest
assured that if they say nothing at the moment, they
will bear you in mind another day.’ The ‘stout masters,’
who were far from brave, began to feel uneasy
and to turn in their stalls. They were in an awkward
dilemma. ‘There is one way of satisfying both
parties,’ continued Bonivard; ‘that is, reply to my
lord of Savoy, and to the people also, that your
business does not extend to alliances and other like
civil matters, but to spiritual things only; that it
does not concern you to make or unmake treaties;
and that your function is only to pray to God and to
pray principally for peace among all men. If you do
this, no one will have reason to be dissatisfied with
you.’</p>

<p>Thus did Bonivard at the beginning of the sixteenth
century lay down a categorical distinction
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
between the spiritual and the temporal government,
and maintain that the Church and the State had
each its own sphere. The canons thought this
theory very strange, and stranger still that a young
man of twenty-five should presume to teach it
them.</p>

<p>The Bishop of Maurienne, who fancied himself a
great diplomatist, was seriously offended. ‘Do you
think, M. de St. Victor,’ he said, ‘that we do not
know how to write a letter?’ ... The Savoyard canons
were exasperated that one of their countrymen should
desire anything but what the duke wished. ‘The
house of Savoy,’ said M. de Monthoux, ‘has conferred
many favours on your predecessors, and is it thus
you show your gratitude?’ ... ‘I would willingly
render service to the duke,’ answered Bonivard, ‘but
before all I will observe my oath to Geneva and the
Church.’ At these words, which resembled a reproach,
murmurs arose from all quarters. Bonivard was not
intimidated. Upright in heart, noble in intention,
wise in counsel, of extraordinary intelligence and superior
talent, he was far above the anger of his venerable
colleagues. ‘Very well, then, gentlemen,’ said
he, ‘do as you please, but I protest that I do not
agree.’ Then turning to the clerk, he said: ‘Write
down that, Mr. Secretary,’ and left the chapter. The
canons were too full of the sense of their own importance
to heed the protest. Persuaded that it was
their duty to check a political movement, which
might besides lead to a religious revolution, these
churchmen, desirous of displaying a courage similar to
that of the Roman senators, peremptorily drew up
their declaration against the Swiss alliance, without
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
regard to the resistance of the people which Bonivard
had predicted.</p>

<p>At the dawn of the canonical institution, when the
scattered priests of a church were assembled by the
bishop into one body, these priests or canons led at
first a life so regular and so strict that the people were
enraptured with them. But that did not last long, and
the lives of these ecclesiastics too often became so disorderly
that the laity turned away from them with
disgust and hatred. It had been so at Geneva. The
decision of the canons was soon known in the city,
and the people immediately assembled in great numbers
in the Place Molard. They described the scene in
the chapter, of which Bonivard may perhaps have given
some hints; and complained that lazy priests should
dare to declare their opinions on public matters and
take side with the enemies of Geneva. They said that
churchmen were always wanting to meddle with
politics, and striving, by flattering authority, to
gratify their avarice and increase their power. It
was proposed to pay these reverend men a visit, and
request them to mind their own affairs and leave state
matters alone. In fact, the patriots were stirring,
and ready, says Bonivard, ‘to proceed in great rage
to assault the canons.’ Aim&eacute; de Gingins, abbot of
Bonmont and episcopal vicar, who lived with his colleagues
in the street still known as the Rue des Chanoines,<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a>
sent in all haste for his friend the prior of
St. Victor, that he might stop the people. Would he
consent? As the canons had rejected his advice,
might he not leave them to get out as they could from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
the evil strait into which they had fallen? Bonivard in
truth hated despotism, and was one of the most honestly
liberal men of the sixteenth century. ‘Monarchical
princes are always enemies of the liberty of the
people,’ he said, ‘and the servants whom they keep
are the same, because they can live in greater licence
under king than under law. This nearly caused the
ruin of Rome, when the young men conspired to restore
the kings, as Livy bears witness in his second
book.’<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a></p>

<p>But if Bonivard was opposed to the despotism of
princes, he was equally so to the disorders of the
people. Accordingly he did not hesitate, but hurried
to the episcopal vicar’s. De Gingins, who was waiting
for the return of his messenger in the keenest anxiety,
flew to meet the prior, exclaiming: ‘Ah, St. Victor,
if you do not give orders, some disaster will happen
to the canons. Our folks have done a foolish thing,
and the people have heard of it: see if you can quiet
them.’<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a></p>

<p>Bonivard hastily lighted a torch (for it was night)
and ran to meet the people. He found them at the top
of the Perron, a steep street, which opens between the
cathedral and the Rue des Chanoines. Berthelier and
the ex-syndic Hugues ‘were in front,’ he tells us. The
former of the two, seeing his friend Bonivard at the
top of the street, with a furred amice upon his head,
holding a torch in one hand, and with the other making
eager signs for them to stop, exclaimed with an oath:
‘Ah! you <i>Bouche-Coppons</i>, you make a fair show in
front with treachery behind.’&mdash;‘Bouche-Coppon (or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
hooded friar) was a name they gave us,’ says the
prior, ‘because we carried the amice on our heads
in winter.’<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a></p>

<p>The moment was critical: the trembling canons
expected to see the people fall upon them; some of
their servants, peering anxiously down the Perron,
from the top of the street watched the movements
of the crowd, and of a sudden shrank back with
terror on hearing the shouts of the advancing huguenots.
In fact the people were exasperated and
demanded that the priests should be brought to
account for meddling with politics. Bonivard did
not flinch: ‘Gently, good sirs,’ he said to the citizens,
‘do not be vexed at trifles; there is not so
much harm done as you think.’ Then ascribing to
the canons his own ideas, he continued: ‘These
reverend gentlemen have written, that they will not
live under other protection than that of God and
St. Peter, and that as for the alliance with Friburg,
they do not mean either to accept or refuse it.... The
letter is not sent yet ... you shall see it!’ Upon this
Besan&ccedil;on Hugues motioned the people to halt, and
the crowd obeyed a magistrate so respected. On his
side Bonivard hastily despatched a messenger to the
Bishop of Maurienne, the most intelligent of the canons,
instructing him to ‘change promptly the purport of the
letter.’ Maurienne privately sent for the secretary
and dictated to him a new despatch such as Bonivard
required. Berthelier, Hugues, and P&eacute;colat, deputed
by the people, arrived shortly after, conducted by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
Bonivard, when Maurienne showed them the new
document. They suspected the trick. ‘Oh no! the ink
is still quite wet,’ they said. However, as the contents
satisfied them, they would not examine the letter too
narrowly, and the people, unwilling to make a disturbance
to no purpose, were satisfied also. ‘Let the business
be settled this once,’ they said; ‘but let us keep a
kick in store for the other courtiers.’ They meant,
no doubt, that having given a smart lesson to the
canons, they reserved the honour of giving another
to the mamelukes. ‘I have inserted this,’ says
Bonivard, concluding his account of this incident, ‘to
caution all republics never to give credit or authority
to people bred in the courts of princes.’<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.<br />

<span class="small">THE DUKE AT THE HEAD OF HIS ARMY SURROUNDS GENEVA.<br />

(<span class="smcap">March and April 1519.</span>)</span></h2>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> duke was at the end of his resources, and the
affair of the chapter had raised his indignation to
its utmost. There had been comedy enough&mdash;it was
time now to come to the tragedy. Everything must
be prepared to crush Geneva and liberty.</p>

<p>The duke raised an army ‘this side the mountains
(that is, in Savoy) as secretly as he could.’ Then fearing
lest the Friburgers, if they were warned, should
hasten to the support of the city, and wishing ‘to catch
the fish without wetting his paws,’ he sent M. de Lambert
into Switzerland to amuse the cantons with fine
speeches. While the ambassador was thus occupying
the attention of Messieurs de Friburg, the Savoyard
nobles hastily summoned their vassals to arms. The
duke placed his forces under the command of the
Sieur de Montrotier, Bonivard’s cousin and an excellent
captain. The latter marched off his troops
during the night and assembled them in silence round
Geneva; so that the duke reached St. Jullien, a league
from the city, with seven thousand soldiers, before
anything was known of his enterprise. The Savoyards
had never done so well before. In a short time the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
people of the neighbourhood, hurrying in crowds to
his standard, raised the ducal army to ten thousand
men.<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a></p>

<p>Then the duke no longer concealed his intentions.
He kept his court at St. Jullien, and there gathered
round the prince an ever-increasing number of nobles
in rich dresses and splendid armour; and especially
of young gentlemen brimful of insolence, who longed
to make a campaign against the noisy shopkeepers.
Never before had this little town witnessed so much
display, or heard so many boasts. ‘We must put them
down with our riding-whips,’ said some. No sooner said
than done. On the 15th of March, 1519, fifteen of these
cavaliers started from St. Jullien to carry out their
plan of campaign; they arrived in Geneva, proceeded
straight to the h&ocirc;tel-de-ville, leaving their horses
with their servants in the street, and with a swaggering
air entered the council-room, all booted and
splashed with mud. Not waiting to be offered chairs,
they rudely sat down, and without any preface said:
‘My lord, desiring to enter this city, orders you to lay
down your arms and to open the gates.’ The Genevan
senators, seated in their curule chairs, looked with
astonishment at this singular embassy; they restrained
themselves, however, and replied at once firmly
and moderately that the duke would be welcome at
Geneva provided he came with his ordinary retinue,
and only to enjoy himself as he had often done before.
‘In that case,’ added the syndics, ‘the arms we carry
will be used only to guard him.’ This seemed to imply
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
that another use might be made of them; and accordingly
the gentlemen answered haughtily: ‘My lord
will enter your city with whom he pleases and do
in it as he pleases.’&mdash;‘Then,’ answered the syndics
bluntly, ‘we will not let him enter.’ At these words
the fifteen cavaliers rose up like one man: ‘We will
enter in spite of your teeth,’ they said, ‘and we will
do in your city whatever we please.’ Then striding
noisily across the flagstones with their spurred boots,
they left the hall, remounted their horses, and galloped
off along the St. Jullien road.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a></p>

<p>As they were seen riding hastily along, fear came
over the population. In truth the moment was
critical. Geneva was from that time for more than
a century under arms, and on repeated occasions,
especially at the epoch of the famous escalade in 1602,
repelled the attacks of Savoy. But the Reform gave
it a strength afterwards which it did not now possess.
The Swiss diet ordered them to receive the duke;
there were only from ten to twelve thousand souls in
the city, including women and children; and the prince
of Piedmont, duke of Savoy, was at their gates with
ten thousand soldiers. They fancied that Charles was
going to enter, to burn and massacre everything: many
families fled in alarm with the most valuable of their
property. But their flight was useless, for the armed
men of Savoy occupied the roads, so that the fugitives
came upon them everywhere. Some returned to the
city: ‘All the country of Savoy is in arms,’ said they;
‘and many of our people have been taken and put to
the torture.’ It was then three o’clock in the afternoon.<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
The patriots assembled: Berthelier, Hugues,
Bonivard, and many others met in order to come to
some understanding. They resolved that it was expedient
to send an embassy to Friburg to inform their
allies of this incident, and to ask for a garrison, as the
duke would not dare to fire a gun at the walls guarded
by the League. But whom should they send? Many
reasons,&mdash;the question of expense being one,&mdash;restrained
the citizens, for they were poor. Bonivard
grew warm: ‘You have exasperated the wolf; he is
at your gates ready to devour you,’ he said, ‘and you
prefer to let him eat up your milk, your butter, and
your cheese&mdash;what am I saying? you would sooner
let him eat yourselves up than give a share of your
pittance to the mastiff that would guard you.’ There
was one man in the meeting who never calculated
when the object was to save his country: this was
Besan&ccedil;on Hugues. He was ill, he had already incurred
debt in the cause of Geneva; but that mattered
not! ‘I will go,’ said he, and he departed.<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a></p>

<p>During this time the fifteen gentlemen had returned
to St. Jullien and made a report of their visit to
the council. Charles and his advisers did not consider
their proceedings very diplomatic, and resolved
to act more officially but more insolently. The next
day, Friday, April 1, the king-at-arms, Provena de
Chablais (he derived this name from the province
where he was born) arrived in Geneva, and was introduced
to the council with the usual ceremony.
A cuirass covered him down to the waist; on his left
arm he wore his casaque or coat of arms, and his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
right hand held a rod,&mdash;a <i>gaule</i>, says a manuscript.
He entered with head erect, without uncovering or
making any bow to the council. ‘Sit down by my
side,’ politely said the premier syndic to him, ‘and unfold
your message.’ Chablais remained standing, with
sneering lip and silent, although the invitation was
repeated thrice. This mute embassy considerably
astonished the Genevan senate. At last, the king-at-arms
quitted his fixed posture and took a seat of his
own accord, not by the side of, but above the syndics
who remained impassive. Then he said: ‘Worshipful
syndics and councillors, do not marvel if I did not sit
down when you desired me, and if I sit down now
without being invited; I will tell you the reason. I
am here in behalf of my most dread prince and lord,
the Duke of Savoy, my master and <i>yours</i>. It does not
become you to tell him to sit down&mdash;it is his privilege
to do so when and where he pleases:&mdash;not beside you
but <i>above</i> you, as your sovereign prince; and as representing
his person, I have done so myself. Now
from my seat I unfold my commission, and it is this.
My lord and yours charges and <i>commands</i> you to
prepare his lodging in your h&ocirc;tel-de-ville with the
sumptuousness and magnificence that belong to such a
prince. Likewise he orders that you will get ready
provisions for him and his company, which will be
ten thousand infantry without including cavalry; for
his intention is to lodge here with this retinue to
administer justice in Geneva.’<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a></p>

<p>The king-at-arms was desired to retire, the council
wishing to deliberate on the answer to be returned.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
The discussion was not a long one, all being unanimous
to maintain firmly the liberties of Geneva.
The herald was called in again, and the first syndic
said to him: ‘Sir Chablais, we are equally surprised
at what you <i>do</i> and at what you <i>say</i>. At what you
do; for after we offered you a seat, you refused it;
and when you had refused it, you took it.... At
what you say; for you say that my lord of Savoy is
your prince and <i>ours</i> ... a thing unheard of until this
time. He may be your prince&mdash;that we believe; but
ours ... no! We are his very humble servants, but
we are neither his subjects nor his vassals.... It
therefore does not belong either to you or to him to
sit in the place where you are.... As for what you
say respecting our h&ocirc;tel-de-ville, we know not what
you mean; the duke may choose any lodging he
pleases except our h&ocirc;tel-de-ville, which we cannot
spare. He will be treated as in former times&mdash;better
if possible. He desires to administer justice;
it is the place of the bishop and council to do so, according
to the franchises which he himself has sworn.
If any one among us has offended him, let him inform
us. Lastly, as to the large train with which he desires
to be attended, it is a singular company for the
administration of justice! Let him please to come
with his usual retinue, nay, with five hundred men;
but ten thousand men and cavalry besides.... We
have not supplies for so many.’<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a></p>

<p>Chablais listened coldly and disdainfully. ‘Will
you or will you not obey the orders of my lord?’ he
said. The first syndic answered bluntly: ‘No.’ The
herald then rose, put on his coat of arms, and with a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
loud voice said: ‘On his behalf then I pronounce you
rebellious to <i>your</i> prince&mdash;and I declare war against
you with fire and sword.’ Then flinging his rod into
the middle of the hall, he continued: ‘I defy you on
the part of my lord, in sign of which I throw down
this rod (gaule); let him take it up who pleases.’
So saying, he left the hall.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a></p>

<p>The news of this singular challenge was immediately
carried to the people, who were dismayed at
it. The huguenots, seeing that they must die or be
slaves (say the annals), chose the first alternative and
prepared for death, resolving, however, to sell their
lives and not to throw them away. Feeling themselves
the strongest body in the city, they called the people
together. ‘Let every one take up arms!’ they said.
They even forced the mamelukes to do so. The
gates were shut, the chains stretched across the
streets, the artillery manned, the watch set: ‘they
made all the preparations for war according to the
skill and experience they had in that business.’<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a></p>

<p>The duke, knowing that right was not on his side,
resolved to draw the sword. Advised by Montrotier,
a daring officer, he had a fit of courage, and, closing
all the roads, sent out his troops in every direction.
It was Saturday, April 2, and market day at
Geneva. The market was held ‘without a word said;’
they allowed everybody to go in and out who wished;<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a>
but about noon a report of the duke’s manœuvre having
reached the city, the inhabitants took up arms.
The peasants, returning from market, described to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
the Savoyards, with some exaggeration perhaps, the
war preparations made by the Genevans. Immediately
the duke’s fit of courage was succeeded by one
of fear. Bonivard had expected this, and on hearing
that the prince was at the head of an army had
shrugged his shoulders. ‘The duke knows as much
of war,’ he said, ‘as a monk bred in a convent since
he was seven years old.’ This display of ten thousand
men, assembled a league from Geneva, these troops
sent out in every direction&mdash;all ended in a pitiful
retractation. M. de Lucinge, appearing before the
council, said: ‘His Highness has ordered me to inform
you, most honoured lords, that he desires to
come and sup with you in a friendly way. If he
cannot lodge in the h&ocirc;tel-de-ville, be so good as to
prepare a lodging elsewhere for him, his great suite,<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a>
and two or three hundred infantry only.... He desires
to do violence to nobody.’ The mamelukes proposed
that the gates should be opened to the duke
immediately, but the syndics replied that they would
consult the general council on the morrow. The
mameluke councillors, who thought that the duke
did Geneva a great honour by coming to it, looked
around with astonishment at the answer: their greatest
happiness was to approach a prince and pay court to
his Highness, and these inflexible huguenots turned
their backs upon him. ‘Well,’ said they, ‘if they
will not let the duke come to us, we will go to him.’
Accordingly Montyon and several others of his party
left the council-room. The court-yard of the h&ocirc;tel-de-ville
was full of citizens waiting to learn the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
result of the meeting: they saw the mamelukes pass
with astonishment. The spectators whispered in each
other’s ears: ‘They are going to join the Savoyards.’ ...
Presently a loud shout was raised, and
several huguenots, catching up some spears that were
resting against the wall, ran after the mamelukes to
seize them; they were almost overtaken when the
councillors, deputed by the syndics, entreated them,
for the safety of the city, to avoid a strife between
citizens. The angry patriots returned to the h&ocirc;tel-de-ville.
Every one was distressed at knowing that
there were among them men capable of forsaking
Geneva for the Duke of Savoy.<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a></p>

<p>The disloyalists (as they were called) hastened
along the St. Jullien road. Besides Montyon, there
were Cartelier, D&eacute;l&eacute;amont, Nergaz, Ray, the two De
Fernex, and others, making in all between thirty and
forty. ‘Our interview with the duke must be private,’
said the cunning Cartelier, who felt how criminal
was the step they were taking. The duke let them
know that at a certain hour of the night he would be
under a particular tree in the Falcon orchard. Thither
they resorted one by one, and were all soon gathered
round the tree without being able to recognise each
other except by the voice. The intriguing Cartelier
was spokesman. Political views influenced Montyon,
De Versonex, and others; but in him, it was the
hatred he bore against the huguenots and the desire
to be revenged on them. He assured the duke that
the majority of the people were ready to acknowledge
him for their sovereign. ‘But,’ he added, ‘the bad
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
ones have shut the gates, stretched the chains,
placed guards.... Enter Geneva, my lord, sword in
hand.’ They then discussed their guilty projects,
and it was agreed in whispers what the mamelukes
should do in order to facilitate the entrance of the
Savoyards into the city. ‘The traitors,’ says Bonivard,
‘entered into a plot with the duke.’<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a></p>

<p>Early on Sunday Charles took up a better position
and went to his strong castle of Gaillard on the
Arve, three-quarters of a league from Geneva. The
report of his intentions having spread through all the
valley of the Leman, the gentlemen and the companies
of the Pays de Vaud, Chablais, and Faucigny came
thronging in. Nay, more: the canons and priests
of the city, quickly forgetting the lesson they had
received, hurried off to Gaillard. Bonivard, who was
almost the only cleric remaining in Geneva, saw all
his theories confirmed. It was his maxim that ‘people
bred up in the courts of princes always remember
their first food.’&mdash;‘And now,’ said he, ‘of all the
canons and folks of the long robe, there are left in
Geneva only De la Biol&eacute;e, Navis, and myself. All
are gone to visit the duke at Gaillard, even M. de
Bonmont who was considered the principal friend
of the public weal.’<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a> Erelong the castle was filled
with an imposing crowd, more numerous than at
St. Jullien.</p>

<p>The storm was approaching, the danger increasing
from hour to hour: the little band of patriots was
still full of courage; but alas! it was an ant-hill
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
on which a rock from the Alps was about to fall.
They had watched the priests with anxious eye, but
without desiring to stop them. ‘These birds have so
keen a scent,’ it was said, ‘that they hasten wherever
there is any flesh.’ If Friburg would only send a
few valiant warriors to assist those of Geneva, that
Savoyard army would soon be dispersed; but Friburg
remained dumb. The uneasiness spread from one to
another; desponding faces were met in the streets....
On a sudden two horsemen are seen on the Swiss
road.... O joy! they wear the Friburg colours!...
At eleven o’clock in the forenoon of Sunday,
April 3, 1519, Berthelier’s friend, Councillor Marti,
accompanied by a herald, entered Geneva. ‘And
your armed men?’ they said to him, and were informed
in answer that, for the present at least, there
were none. The general council happening to be
assembled in order to reply to M. de Lucinge, Marti
instantly proceeded thither, but was not received so
well as he had expected. ‘We want ambassadors in
doublets and not in long robes,’ said the huguenots
to him; ‘not diplomatists, but soldiers.’ Marti
started for Gaillard, but the Genevans saw him depart
without hope; in their opinion, arquebuses should be
the only answer for the Savoyards.<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a></p>

<p>The Friburger, as he drew near Gaillard, was
struck with the large number of troops around the
castle. At this moment the duke was giving audience
to the canons, who were making all the bows
and compliments learnt in former days at court; he
hoped to be able to draw them into the plot, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
was therefore much annoyed at seeing this mediator
arrive. Turning impatiently towards his officers, he
vented in an under tone some contemptuous words
against him. Nevertheless, a few minutes later,
when he had examined him more closely, Charles took
courage, doubting not that his political skill would
easily manage this shepherd of the Alps. ‘He seems
a good plain man, easy to be deceived,’ said the duke,
who, commencing his manœuvres, added: ‘Sit down,
Mr. Ambassador,’ and thereupon feasted him liberally,
and gave him all kinds of good words. But the
plain man, who was in reality a bold and crafty
Friburger, replied in his Romane tongue: ‘My lord,
you have already told my friends so many lies, that I
do not know if they will believe you any more.’<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a> The
duke, offended at this rude language, spoke more
sharply: ‘I shall enter Geneva as a friend,’ he said;
‘or, if they do not like it, as an enemy. My artillery
is all ready to <i>lather</i> (savonner) the city in case of
refusal.’ Marti in alarm demanded a truce, at least
for the night, so that he might speak to the people of
Geneva and settle the matter, which the duke granted.<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a></p>

<p>All the citizens were afoot: the guards at the gates,
the cannon on the walls, the watch day and night in
the streets. At ten o’clock Marti arrived, and went
straight to the council, whose sittings were declared
permanent. ‘Gentlemen,’ said he to the syndics, ‘I
think you must trust the duke and let him enter the
city.’&mdash;‘And the assistance of Friburg?’ asked some;
to which Marti replied: ‘My lords are far away!’<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
He seemed to have lost all hope. He added, however:
‘There is a truce until to-morrow morning.’
It was agreed to convene the Great Council the next
morning before daybreak in order to deliberate on the
course to be taken in this terrible crisis; and as the
citizens had been on foot for three nights, they were
permitted in consideration of the truce to go and take
some repose. It was then eleven o’clock.</p>

<p>It struck twelve. No sound was heard but the
measured steps of the sentinels; a dark night covered
the city with its curtain, and all were asleep. Suddenly
the flash of a torch gleamed from the top of one
of the three towers of St. Pierre; it was the signal
agreed upon between Cartelier and the duke at the
nocturnal conference held under the tree in the
Falcon orchard: that flash announced that the Swiss
could enter without resistance. The noise of horses
was heard almost immediately without the city, in
the direction of St. Antoine, and a loud blow was
struck on the gate. It was Philip, count of Genevois,
the duke’s brother, at the head of his cavalry: having
knocked, he waited for the mamelukes to open
according to their promise. But the sentry at the
St. Antoine gate, who had seen the torch and
heard the knock, suspecting treachery, fired his arquebus
and gave the alarm. Immediately the tocsin
sounded; the citizens awoke, grasped their arms, and
hurried in the direction of the attack. ‘All were
much frightened and vexed, and great uproar was
made in the city.’ Everybody was running about
shouting and ordering. The count, who was listening,
began to fear that the plot had failed. In the
midst of the confusion, a clap of thunder was heard,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
which terrified both sides. The count and his followers
hesitated no longer, but retired; the Genevans
did the same, and a few angry patriots, as they passed
Marti’s house on their way home, went in and asked
him angrily: ‘Is this the fine truce you brought
us?’<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a></p>

<p>The Grand Council met before daybreak on Monday,
April 4. The mamelukes made an excuse for
the night affair: it was no doubt a patrol of cavalry
which had advanced too far. But Marti did not conceal
the danger: ‘The duke is at your gates with his
whole army,’ he said: ‘if you comply with his demands,
he told me you would be satisfied with him; if
not, he will enter by force this very afternoon. Make
a virtue of necessity; or, at the least, send him a
deputation.’ The syndics started for Gaillard immediately.
The duke received them most graciously
and affectionately. ‘I will enter Geneva with none
but my ordinary retinue,’ he told them; ‘I will take
only five hundred footmen for my guard and dismiss
all the rest of my army. I will do no injury either
to the community or to individuals, and my stay shall
not be long.’ His Highness made so many promises
and oaths that entrance was at last yielded to
him.</p>

<p>When this resolution of the council was known,
the indignant patriots threw away their arquebuses;
all laid down their arms, and a profound dejection
came over men’s minds. Cries of vexation and of
sorrow were heard, but there still lingered here and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
there a hope that God would finally deliver the
city.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a></p>

<p>On the morning of Tuesday, April 5, the duke set
all his army in motion. <i>All!</i>... When they heard of
this, the Genevans hastened to remonstrate with him.
‘My people will only pass through Geneva,’ he answered;
‘fear nothing, but open your gates.’&mdash;‘Certainly,’
added some mamelukes; ‘be easy; they will
come in at one gate and go out at another.’ The
triumph of violence and craft was about to be
achieved. A people, too simple and confiding, were
now to be crushed under the feet of a powerful
prince and of his numerous satellites. All the gates
were opened, and those which had been walled up
were broken down. The huguenots, who had voted
unhesitatingly against the admission of Charles into
the city, looked on with indignation at this sad
sight; but they were determined to be present to
the end at the humiliation of Geneva. Bonivard
was the most provident; he took the alarm: he had
no culverins now in his priory, and he could not
have resisted the Savoy army with his ten monks.
‘Consent to the duke’s entrance ... what madness!’
he exclaimed. ‘Certainly those who know <i>his honesty</i>,
of whom I am one, are aware of what will happen.’
And this, in Bonivard’s opinion, was, that he would be
the first victim sacrificed by the duke, and that there
would be many others. ‘Wishing,’ he tells us, ‘to be
wiser and cleverer than the rest,’ he hastily escaped
into the Pays de Vaud. Berthelier, who was more
exposed than his friend, and who saw clearly his end
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
approaching, was not frightened. He knew that the
defenders of law and liberty serve their cause by their
deaths as well as by their lives, and determined to
await the attacks of Charles and the bastard.<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.<br />

<span class="small">THE ARMY OF SAVOY IN GENEVA.<br />

(<span class="smcap">April and May 1519.</span>)</span></h2>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> army of Savoy approached the St. Antoine
gate: it was like a triumphal progress. Monarchy,
according to politicians, was about to gain the victory
over republicanism. ‘In front marched the Count of
Genevois, in complete steel armour,’ say the chronicles,
‘wearing a long plume, and riding on a stout stallion,
who curvetted about so that it was pleasant to see.’
He was followed by the cavalry in breast-plates.
Then came the main body, to the number of about
eight thousand infantry, headed by six Genevan
mamelukes. Last appeared the duke, followed by all
his guard; he had laid aside his gracious humour,
and desired that his entrance should have something
warlike and alarming. ‘Montrotier,’ he said to his
principal captain, ‘I have sworn that I will only enter
Geneva <i>over</i> the gates.’ Montrotier understood him,
and, going forward with a body of men, knocked
down the St. Antoine gate and the adjoining wall.
The satisfied duke now resumed his triumphal
march. He was armed from head to foot and rode a
handsome hackney: two pages carried before him his
lance and his helmet. One of these was J. J. de
Watteville, afterwards <i>avoyer</i> of Berne. The weak-minded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
Charles, inflated with his success, pulled up
his courser, and made him paw the rebellious stones.
‘A true Don Quixote,’ says a catholic historian, ‘he
showed the same pride as a conqueror loaded with
glory who at the cost of much blood and fatigue had
reduced a fortress after a long and dangerous siege.’
And if we may believe contemporary documents,
‘Charles advanced more like a Jupiter surrounded with
his thunders than a conqueror; his head was bare in
order, said his courtiers, that his eyes, flashing with
wrath, should blast the audacity of the Genevans who
should be rash enough to look in his face.’ All the
army having passed the gate after him marched
through the city in order to parade its triumph in
the streets and defy the citizens.<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a></p>

<p>In conformity with the engagements made by the
duke, his soldiers entering by one gate ought, after
crossing the city, to have gone out by the other.
Bonivard on hearing of this had shaken his head. ‘It
will be with Geneva as with Troy,’ said the classical
prior; ‘the Savoyards, entering by stratagem like the
Greeks of Sinon, will afterwards remain by force.’
And so it happened, for the whole army took up its
quarters immediately in the city. The bands of Faucigny,
which were the most terrible, established themselves
at St. Gervais by order of the duke; those of
the Pays de Vaud at St. Leger, up to the Arve; those
of Chablais at the Molard and along the Rhone; those
of Savoy and Genevois in the Bourg de Four and the
upper part of the city. The nobles were lodged in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
best houses situated principally between Rive and the
Molard. The duke took up his quarters also on the
left bank, near the lake, in the Maison de Nice which
belonged to Bonivard. The count, appointed by his
brother governor of the city, fixed his head-quarters
at the h&ocirc;tel-de-ville. Geneva was taken; the Duke
of Savoy had made himself master of it by perjury,
and there he intended to remain. Many citizens
thought their country for ever lost. The plans formed
during so many years and even centuries, were realised
at last; despotism, triumphant in Geneva, was about
to trample under foot law, constitution, and liberty.
The Savoyards had seen from their mountain-tops a
fire in this city which disquieted them&mdash;a fire whose
flames might extend and consume the time-worn edifices
their fathers had raised. They were now going
to stifle these flames, to extinguish the embers, and
scatter the ashes; the duke, the emperor his brother-in-law,
and his nephew Francis I. might henceforth at
their pleasure oppress their subjects, put martyrs to
death, wink at the disorders of nobles and monks, and
sleep quietly on their pillows.</p>

<p>The Savoyard princes behaved as in a city taken by
assault. The very evening of the 5th of April, the
Count of Genevois removed the cannon from the ramparts,
placed them round his quarters, and had them
loaded that they might be ready to fire upon the
people, the h&ocirc;tel-de-ville thus becoming a citadel to
keep Geneva in obedience. Notwithstanding these
precautions the count was uneasy; he had violated
his oaths, and knew that he had to deal with men of
energy. He did not lie down, and at two in the
morning his officers went by his orders and knocked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
at the doors of the four syndics, commanding them
to proceed immediately to the h&ocirc;tel-de-ville. ‘Hand
me the keys of the gates,’ said the count, ‘the ramparts,
the arsenal, and the provision magazines.’ If
the magistrates had really fancied that the Savoyards
would come as friends, their foolish delusion must
now have ceased and the bandage have fallen from
their eyes. But how could they resist? The army
filled all the city, and the citizens were divided: the
syndics did what was required of them. The fanaticism
of the disloyal mamelukes was not yet satisfied.
Cartelier, Pierre Joly, Thomas Moyne, and others,
taking a lesson from the terrible Montrotier, who
desired to <i>muzzle</i> the Genevans completely, visited
all the streets, squares, and churches, and began to
wrench off the staples and locks from the city chains
and gates, and even the clappers from the bells. The
syndics strove in vain to stop this violence. The
wretches did not forget a street, and having thus disarmed
Geneva, they carried all these trophies to the
duke. ‘It is a sign,’ said they, laying them before
him, ‘of the real transfer of the jurisdiction of the
city, to intimidate the rebels and deprive them of all
hope of succour. Geneva lies at the feet of your
Highness.’ This occurred before daybreak.<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a></p>

<p>At length Wednesday, 6th April, dawned, and that
day was not less mournful than its predecessor. The
Savoyard soldiers, forgetting that they owed their
success to the scandalous violation of the most sacred
promises, intoxicated alike with hatred and pride,
began to show the insolence of conquerors. We know
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
the disorders in which the undisciplined armies of
that period were accustomed to indulge in cities
taken by storm. The ducal soldiers, not less cruel
but more fantastical, exhibited in the sack of Geneva
some of those farces which the imperialists played
eight years later at the sack of Rome. The citizens,
taking refuge in the garrets, had given up their feather
beds to the soldiers. The latter slept soundly, and
next morning, to make up for the battle which had
not been fought, indulged in one of a different kind.
Instead of balls they flung the bolsters at each other’s
heads; taking the beds for enemies, they thrust their
swords up to the hilt in the feathers:&mdash;these were the
hardest blows struck in this war by the soldiers of
Charles III.&mdash;Then, eager to prolong their coarse
jests, they shook the beds out of the windows, watching,
with roars of laughter, the evolutions made by
the feathers in the air. They next called for the keys
of the cellars, and forming a circle round the casks,
tapped them in various places, singing their loudest
as they drank their fill. ‘Lastly,’ says a chronicle,
‘they pulled out the spigots, so that the cellar was
filled with wine; and stumbling upstairs again into
the house, they insulted everybody they met, ran
shouting through the streets, made boasting speeches,
and committed a thousand acts of violence.’ At Rome,
the imperialists made a jest of the papacy; at Geneva,
the ducal soldiers, drunk with wine and joy, trampled
independence under foot and exulted over liberty.
But on a sudden, an alarm was sounded: the braggarts
imagined that the Genevans were going to defend
themselves, and, the noisiest talkers being generally the
greatest cowards, they all scampered away&mdash;some ran
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
to the right, others to the left; many fled towards the
river and hid themselves under the mills; the more
cunning sought other retreats.<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a> It was only a false
alarm; the Count of Genevois, being displeased at
their behaviour, had given it that it might serve as a
lesson to the marauders.</p>

<p>During this time the mamelukes were sitting night
and day in ‘the little stove,’ consulting on the best
means of repressing for ever the spirit of national independence
in Geneva. They believed the city could
never belong to Savoy whilst those who had voted
for the alliance with Friburg were alive. A king of
Rome, while walking in his garden, struck off with his
stick the heads of the tallest poppies. The conspirators,
resolving to profit by the lessons of history, began to
draw up a proscription list, and placed on it the four
syndics, the twenty-one councillors, and other notable
citizens so as to make up forty. Wishing to end the
affair promptly, certain mamelukes went to the executioner
and asked him ‘how much he would take for
forty heads?’ It seems that he required more than
the heads were worth, according to the value which had
been set upon them, for contemporary documents tell
us that they ‘haggled’ about it. Three chronicles of
the time, all worthy of trust, describe this disgusting
visit to the headsman.<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a> The rumour got abroad, and
all Geneva trembled. Some who knew they were on
the list, hid themselves. ‘A very foolish thing,’ said
others. ‘Without God, the most secret hiding-places
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
are but as the fancies of children, who put their hands
before their eyes and think nobody can see them.’
The boldest huguenots were filled with indignation:
instead of concealing themselves, they girded on their
swords, raised their heads, and walked proudly in the
streets. ‘But they were made to <i>feel the cord</i> (sentir
la corde).’ We do not know whether this means that
they were beaten or only threatened. ‘After this,’
continues Savyon, ‘there was no other resource but to
commend ourselves to God.’<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a></p>

<p>Berthelier and his friends hurried to Marti. They
represented to him that at the moment when the duke
had made such fine promises, he was thinking only
of breaking them; they added that assuredly this perjured
prince would have to answer for his crime.
The Friburger, at once ashamed and indignant, went
to the duke and said: ‘What do you mean, my lord?
Do you wish me to be accounted a traitor? I have
your word. You bade me give the people of Geneva
assurance of your good will; they consequently opened
their gates in good faith; otherwise you would not
have entered without hard knocks. But now you
break your promise.... My lord, you will certainly
suffer by it.’ The duke, embarrassed and annoyed
and unable to justify himself, got into a passion, and
offered the Friburg ambassador the grossest insult:
‘Go,’ said he, addressing Marti with an epithet so
filthy that history cannot transcribe his words, ‘get
out of my presence.’<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a></p>

<p>This incident, however, made Charles reflect, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
resolve to give a colour to his violence. Having drawn
out all his men-at-arms, he summoned a general
council. Only the mamelukes attended, and not all of
them; but notwithstanding their small number, these
ducal partisans, surrounded by an armed force, did
not scruple to renounce, in the name of Geneva, the
alliance with Friburg.</p>

<p>The duke immediately followed up his victory;
and, wishing to make the hand of the master felt,
ordered, in the morning of Thursday, April 7, that
the ushers and men-at-arms should attend the city
herald and make proclamation with an increased
display of force. ‘O yes! O yes! O yes!’ said the
herald, ‘in the name of our most dread prince and
lord, Monseigneur the Duke of Savoy. No one, under
pain of three blows of the strappado, shall carry any
offensive or defensive weapon. No one shall leave his
house, whatever noise there may be, or even put his
head out of the window, under pain of his life.
Whoever resists the order of Monseigneur shall be
hanged at the windows of his own house.’ Such were
the order and justice established by Duke Charles.<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a> It
might be said that, with a view to frighten the Genevans,
he wished that they might not be able to leave their
houses without walking in the midst of his victims.
The proclamation was repeated from place to place,
and the crowd gradually increased. On a sudden, a
certain movement was observed among the people. A
few men appeared here and there, whose look had something
mysterious; they spoke to their friends, but it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
was in whispers. The agitation soon increased; it
spread from one to another: here a man made signs
of joy, there of terror. At last the mystery was explained.
‘Friburg!’ exclaimed several voices; ‘the
Friburg army is coming!’ At these words the city
herald, the men-at-arms, the mamelukes, and the
Savoyards who accompanied him, stopped, and, on
learning that a courier had just arrived from the Pays
de Vaud, they dispersed.... Huguenots and mamelukes
spread through the city and circulated the good
news: ‘The Swiss! the Swiss!’ and the cry was answered
from all quarters with ‘Long live the huguenots!’
‘Thus the said proclamation could not be
finished throughout the city,’ says a contemporary
manuscript.<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a></p>

<p>Besan&ccedil;on Hugues, having escaped all the perils of
the road, had arrived at Friburg, and, without giving
himself time to take breath, appeared immediately
before the council. He described the perfidy and
violence of Charles, the dangers and desolation of Geneva;
he showed that the city was on the point of
being annexed to Savoy, and the chiefs of the republic
about to be put to death. If Friburg did not make
haste, it would find nothing but their heads hanging
at the gates, like those of Navis and Blanchet.</p>

<p>The look of the generous citizen, the animation of
his whole person, the eloquence of his appeal, inflamed
every heart. Their eyes were filled with tears, and the
men of Friburg laid their hands upon their swords.<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a>
A regiment, fully armed, marched out immediately for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
Geneva: and that was not all; the flower of the young
men flocked in from every quarter, and the army soon
amounted to 5,000 or 6,000 men. Having entered
the Pays de Vaud, they seized his Highness’s governor,
the Sire de Lullins. ‘Write to your master,’ said the
chiefs of Friburg, ‘that he do no harm to our fellow-citizens;
your head shall answer for theirs: besides,
we are going to give him a treat at Geneva.’ Their
liberating flags soon floated on the hills above the lake.
A great number of the young men of the Pays de Vaud
joined them, and the army mustered before Morges
13,000 to 14,000 strong. At their approach, the terrified
inhabitants of that town, who were devoted to
the duke, threw themselves into their boats, and fled
to Savoy. The Friburgers entered their deserted
houses, and waited for his Highness’s answer.<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a></p>

<p>Governor de Lullins failed not to warn his master,
and it was this message that had interrupted the proclamation.
The duke, at once violent and pusillanimous,
was frightened, and suddenly became as humble as he
had been insolent before. Sending for the ambassador
of Friburg, he spoke to him as to a dear friend: ‘Haste
to the camp at Morges,’ he said, ‘and stop this: prevail
upon your lords to return.’ Marti, who had not
forgotten Charles’s gross insult, answered him bitterly:
‘Do you think that a &mdash;&mdash; like me can make an army
retreat? Commission your own people to carry your
lies.’<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a> Then the duke, still more terrified, sent M. de
Maglian, a captain of cavalry, to guard the pass at
Nyon, and, ‘changing his song,’ he had it cried through
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
all the city ‘that no one should dare do harm or displeasure
to any person of Geneva, under pain of the
gallows.’ At the same time, the Sieur de Saleneuve
and another of his Highness’s councillors went to the
general council, but this time without riding-whips or
wands, and with a benevolent smile upon their faces.
There, after assuring the people of the love the duke
bore them, they were asked to send two citizens to
Morges to declare to the Friburgers that the duke
would do no injury to Geneva. Two mamelukes,
Taccon and De Lestilley, departed.<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a></p>

<p>Everything was changed in Geneva. The proposal
to cut off forty heads was abandoned, to the great
regret of Cartelier, who afterwards said: ‘What a pity!
but for these &mdash;&mdash; Friburgers it would have been
done.’<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a> The huguenots, regaining their courage,
‘mocked at the Faucignerans and the other men-at-arms.’<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a>
The inhabitants of the Faubourg St. Gervais,
strongly inclined to raillery, attacked their guests with
songs, epigrams, and sarcasms. The huguenots imposed
on their visitors a strict fast (it was the season
of Lent), and gave them for rations only some small
fish called <i>b&eacute;solles</i> (now <i>f&eacute;ras</i>). ‘You are too good
christians,’ they said ironically to the Savoyards, ‘to
eat meat now.’ And hence they derisively called the
expedition ‘the B&eacute;solles war,’ a name recorded in
contemporaneous chronicles.</p>

<p>They could not come to an understanding at Morges.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
Besan&ccedil;on Hugues and Malbuisson were urging the
Friburg troops to advance; Taccon and De Lestilley
were urging them to retire. And while the leaders
hesitated, the deputies of the cantons arrived and proposed
a middle course: that Savoy should withdraw
her troops, and Friburg her alliance. It was Zurich,
Berne, and Soleure that sought thus to take advantage
of the opportunity to withdraw from Geneva the only
help which, after God, could save her. The huguenots,
abandoned by the cantons, stood stupefied. ‘Renounce
your alliance with Friburg,’ repeated the
League, ‘<i>without prejudice to your liberties</i>.’ ‘But
they would not,’ said Bonivard, ‘for they had the
majority of votes.’ The real majority did not therefore
consent to this fatal proposition; but it seems
that it was again carried by the phantom of a general
council, at which none but mamelukes were present.
When that was done, the duke hastened to leave
Geneva, but with less pomp than when he entered;
and the plague took his place.<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a></p>

<p>When Charles quitted the city, he left behind him
sad forebodings. The Swiss accused the Genevans of
violence and insults, declaring them guilty of disgraceful
conduct to the duke, their most illustrious ally.<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a>
The bishop, who was at Pignerol, wrote to the citizens:
‘Having recovered from my serious illness, I am
thinking of passing the mountains, for the benefit and
good of my city.’<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a> Now every one remembered that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
he had made use of the same words when he had put
Navis and Blanchet to death. The signs were threatening:
the sky was thick with storm. The citizens
trembled for those who were most precious to them,
and frightful deeds were about to increase and prolong
their terror. ‘From the war of 1519 until 1525,’ says
the learned Secretary of State Chouet, ‘the people of
Geneva was in great consternation.’<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.<br />

<span class="small">ARREST OF BONIVARD AND BERTHELIER.<br />

(<span class="smcap">April to September 1519.</span>)</span></h2>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Neither</span> the duke nor the bishop had exhausted
their plans. The heads of Blanchet and Navis,
suspended seven months before on the walnut-tree,
were there still, tossed by every wind, and telling the
passers-by that the wrath of the princes was not yet
appeased. The bishop asked himself whether these
commoners, who claimed liberty in the State, would
delay much longer before demanding liberty in the
Church.... People spoke of extraordinary things that
were happening in Germany. A Wittemberg doctor
had appealed from the pope to a general council, and
was preparing to maintain certain propositions at
Leipsic in which the primacy of the Roman Church
was denied as being opposed to the history of eleven
centuries and to the text of Scripture. Would
these strange notions, worthy of the Germans, spread
to countries nearer Rome? Would Wittemberg and
Geneva, those two little corners of the earth, be two
volcanoes to shake the ground around them? A remedy
must be applied at any cost, and those principles
of civil and religious liberty be stifled, which,
if not seen to in time, might work strange revolutions
in the world.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span></p>

<p>The bishop on his return from Turin had merely
passed through Geneva; and fleeing from the plague,
had taken refuge at Ripaille, near Thonon, whence he
made the most serious complaints to the Genevans.
‘You are always conspiring,’ he wrote, ‘in order
that you may satisfy the appetites of a <i>heap</i> of individuals
who are plotting against their honour and
against me.’<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a> About the end of June he removed to
the ch&acirc;teau of Troches, near Dovaine. The principal
mamelukes hastened to this ancient manorial house.<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">251</a>
They had no very clear ideas of what was going on in
Germany, and of the consequences that might result
to Europe; their attachment to the ducal and episcopal
cause depended rather upon motives of interest
and family tradition; but they instinctively felt that a
struggle had begun in Geneva between the old and
the new times, and that the partisans of the former
must combine all their strength against the latter.
They made the halls of the ch&acirc;teau reecho with their
loud voices; they entered into cowardly conspiracies;
these supporters of feudalism, however honourable
they might be in other matters, shrank not from any
crime to check the advent of liberty. There was one
citizen in particular whom they hated&mdash;one life that
must be sacrificed. ‘First,’ said they to the bishop,
‘we require Berthelier’s death, and pray, my lord,
let the blow be prompt. Second, the rebellious councillors
must be dismissed. Third, your grace must
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
come into the city ... with <i>good swords</i>!’ The
mamelukes undertook to find employment for these
swords, and the bishop said ‘Amen.’</p>

<p>The cruelties of the princes of Savoy had already
fallen upon Bonivard. The very day when the duke
entered the city, the prior of St. Victor left it, ‘disguised
as a monk,’ accompanied by two friends of the
Pays de Vaud with whom he was very familiar, the
Sieur de Voruz and the Abbot of Montheron. ‘Fear
nothing,’ said the latter to him; ‘we will go first to my
abbey; then we will conduct you to Echallens, a town
dependent on Berne, where you will be in safety.’
But they were leading him to a very different place of
safety. The priest and the gentleman had made their
account together. They had said that no one in
Geneva was more hated by the bishop and the duke
than Bonivard, that in their eyes he was not a Genevese,
but a Savoyard who had betrayed his prince; so
that, to get him into their power, these princes would
give his weight in gold. The priory of St. Victor was
a good benefice; the two perfidious friends had therefore
determined to propose an exchange: they would
put the duke in possession of the prior, while the duke
should put them in possession of the priory. This establishment
would naturally fall to the abbot; but the
latter engaged to pay the Sieur de Voruz an annual
pension of two hundred florins out of the stipend. The
flashing of the gold dazzled these wretches, and they
concluded their infamous bargain. The gentleman and
the abbot appeared to redouble their vigilance lest any
harm should befall the prior. When the three travellers
reached Montheron, in the forest of Jorat, between
Lausanne and Echallens, the prior was courteously
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
conducted into a room, which, without his suspecting
it, was to be his prison. The next morning Voruz,
whom Bonivard trusted like a brother, entered the
chamber, sat down opposite him, and, laying a sheet
of paper on the table, said: ‘Resign your priory of
St. Victor in favour of the abbot.’&mdash;‘What!’ exclaimed
the startled Bonivard, ‘is it under a show of
friendship that you lay these plots?’&mdash;‘You are our
prisoner,’ Voruz answered coldly; ‘all attempts to
escape will be useless.’ Bonivard now understood
into what hands he had fallen. ‘So, then, instead of
taking me to Echallens,’ he said, ‘you will prevent
my going there.’ He declared that he would set his
hand to no such robbery, and bluntly refused to resign
his priory. ‘The duke is going to put Berthelier
and his companions to death,’ resumed Voruz coldly;
‘be careful. If you will not do what we tell you, we
will deliver you into his hands, and there will be one
huguenot the more for the scaffold. You are free;
make your choice&mdash;resignation or death!’ Bonivard
had no wish to die. Could he leave so soon this
world that he loved so passionately? Could he see
rudely interrupted that beautiful dream of liberty,
philosophy, and poetry, in whose chimeras he had so
long indulged? He consented to everything. ‘Good!’
said Voruz, as he took away with him the renunciation
the prior had signed, and locked the door behind him.</p>

<p>Bonivard, who thought himself free now that he had
become poor, had to learn that the tender mercies of
the wicked are cruel. He was immediately given up
by Voruz and the abbot to the duke, who had him
conveyed to Gex by the captain of his guards. He
asserted in vain that his only fault was being a friend
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
of the huguenots and of the Swiss; Charles, in whose
eyes that was a great crime, imprisoned him in the
castle of Grol&eacute;e, on the banks of the Rhone, two
leagues from Belley.<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a> This first imprisonment, which
lasted two years, was a foretaste of his harsher and
longer captivity in the castle of Chillon. The duke
put the abbot in possession of the priory of St. Victor;
Voruz received his two hundred florins; the wicked
triumphed, and Bonivard in his solitude gave way to
gloomy thoughts. Was it at the bottom of an obscure
dungeon that the new times of light and liberty were
to begin?</p>

<p>The duke having struck the first blow, it was now
the bishop’s turn. He was taking his holiday, travelling
from Ripaille to Troches, from Troches to the
castle of Bonne, thence to other adjoining places, and
employing all his episcopal zeal in raising soldiers.
On the 16th of August the peasants of these districts,
who came to the market at Geneva, mentioned that
the bishop was assembling armed men for his entrance
into the city. The syndic De la Mare and one of his
colleagues, alarmed for the future of the republic,
set out immediately for Bonne, and commended the
city to John’s episcopal tenderness. ‘Alas!’ they
said, ‘it is stricken with the double scourge of the
plague and the sword.’ The prelate, as false as his
cousin, replied: ‘You have been deceived, gentlemen;
I shall certainly enter Geneva to-morrow, but
only with a hundred or a hundred and fifty footmen
for my guard. I desire to live there merrily with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
citizens and protect each one in his rights.’<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a> De la
Mare and his friend believed what John of Savoy told
them, and made their report. The people of the city
were somewhat reassured: that little weak and starveling
bishop, who looked so like a corpse, seemed not a
very formidable appearance to them. They resolved
at least to hide the discontent and fears that they felt
at heart. ‘The shops will be closed, as on a holiday,’
said the council, ‘and those who have horses will go
out to meet his lordship.’</p>

<p>On Saturday, April 20, 1519, the syndics and
a great part of the city were afoot. At four in the
afternoon the bishop’s escort came in sight; the perfidious
prelate, who was coming for the purpose of
putting the noblest of the citizens to death, noted
with a cunning look the handsome reception made
him. Six hundred soldiers, stout rough men, surrounded
the pastor of Geneva; ‘the bishop had
thought that number necessary,’ say the annals, ‘to
take Berthelier.’ The Genevans, remembering that
John was only to bring with him one hundred or one
hundred and fifty men-at-arms, counted ... and found
six hundred. They saw that the prelate’s entrance
was only a second edition of that of the duke. The
bastard, satisfied with the welcome he received, proceeded
immediately to his palace and without delay
convened the general council for the next day. Sadness
was in all men’s hearts.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning, when the people were assembled,
the bishop appeared, surrounded by his councillors
and courtiers. He seemed scarcely alive, but his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
sullen fierce look announced severe measures. ‘My
lord not having many days to live,’ said the official,
‘desires that all things be put in order before his decease.
He has therefore brought some soldiers with
him that he may correct any who shall be mad enough
to resist him.’<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a></p>

<p>After delivering this threatening message, the
bishop returned hastily to his palace, where he remained
shut up for two days without giving any signs
of life. He had selected his first victim and was
ruminating in silence on the means of sacrificing him.
‘He kept still,’ said Bonivard, ‘watching for Berthelier,
whom he considered the leader of the flock.’ During
this time his satellites, however, did not keep quiet.
Being quartered on the huguenots, they stole all they
could carry off; if resistance was made, they used
insulting language; they went about marauding. But
the bishop still gave no word or sign. This silence
alarmed all the city, and every one expected what
was going to happen.<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a></p>

<p>One man alone in Geneva preserved a tranquil heart
and serene look; it was Berthelier. He had not wished
to escape either when Charles or when the bastard
entered; he was vainly entreated to withdraw to
Friburg; all was useless. He waited for death; the
‘cheat’ of hope (to use the common expression) did
not deceive him. ‘The wolf is in the fold,’ said his
friends, ‘and you will be the first victim.’ Berthelier
listened, smiled, and passed on. In his opinion there
could be no evil in life to him who has learnt that the
privation of life is not an evil. He awaited calmly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
that tragical end which he had himself foretold, every
day exposing himself to the attacks of his enemies.
After the bishop’s arrival, ‘he went and came just as
before; one would have said that, instead of fleeing
death, he was running after it.’<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a></p>

<p>Without the city, in a solitary place then called
Gervasa (now corrupted into <i>Savoises</i>), was a quiet
meadow, which the Rhone bathed with its swift waters:
this was Berthelier’s favourite retreat. Remote from
the noise of the city, seated on the picturesque bank
of the river, watching its blue waves gliding rapidly
past, he dwelt on the swiftness of time, and casting a
serious glance into the future, he asked himself when
would Geneva be free? ‘Every day he was in the
habit of taking his pleasure there,’ say the annals, ‘and
never omitted doing so, although at the time he had
so many enemies in Geneva.’<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a></p>

<p>On Tuesday, August 23, he went out between
six and seven to breathe the morning air in his
favourite retreat.<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a> Berthelier was now forty years
of age; everything foretold him that his end was near;
but he preferred, without passion and without fear, to
make the passage from life to death. This active and
much-dreaded citizen began to sport, but with a serious
gentleness, upon the brink of the grave. He had a little
weasel which he was very fond of, and ‘for the greater
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
contempt of his enemies,’ he had taken the tame
‘creature in his bosom, and thus walked out to his
garden, playing with it.’ The vidame, who knew of
these morning walks, had given orders for a certain
number of soldiers to be posted outside the walls of
the city, whilst he remained within, in order to take
Berthelier from behind. Just as the latter was about
to pass the gates, the troop that awaited him came
forward. Berthelier, ‘always <i>booted</i> and ready to
depart for the unknown shores of eternity,’ had no
thought of returning to the city and arousing the
youth of Geneva; he did not turn aside from the
road, but continued gently caressing his weasel, and
‘walked straight towards the armed men, as proudly
as if he was going to take them.’<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">259</a></p>

<p>‘They met,’ says a manuscript, ‘under the trellis
in front of the hostelry of the Goose,’<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a> and the vidame,
who was descending the hill on his mule, coming up
with him at the same time, laid his hand upon his
shoulder, saying: ‘In the name of my lord of Geneva,
I arrest you,’ and prepared to take away his sword.
Berthelier, who had only to sound his terrible whistle
to collect enthusiastic defenders, stood calm, without a
thought of resistance, and quietly handed his sword to
the vidame, contenting himself with the words: ‘Take
care what you do with this sword, for you will have to
answer for it.’</p>

<p>The vidame placed him in the middle of his soldiers,
and Berthelier marched off quietly, still carrying the
weasel with him. The little timid animal thrust its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
pretty head into its master’s bosom, while the latter
encouraged it by gentle caresses. In this way he
arrived at the Ch&acirc;teau de l’Ile, and the vidame, stationing
guards everywhere, even in the prisoner’s
chamber,<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a> shut him up in C&aelig;sar’s tower. On the
spot where walls had formerly been erected by the
destroyer of the liberties of Rome, a humble and
almost unknown citizen, one of the founders of modern
liberty, was to find a bloody prison.<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">262</a></p>

<p>Berthelier, shut up in the fortress, and surrounded
by guards pacing up and down his chamber and round
the castle, felt more free than all of them. We do not
say that he possessed the freedom that christianity
gives; perhaps it was rather from the <i>Tusculans</i> of
Cicero than from the Gospel that he had derived the
calm with which his soul was filled; yet it is almost
impossible not to recognise a noble, serious&mdash;we could
almost say christian sentiment in him. As he saw
death approaching, he said that all it had to do was
to remove its mask, for underneath was the face of a
friend. To die ... what was that? Does not the
meanest soldier expose himself to it on the battle-field?
Was not the death he was about to suffer for the independence
of his country a thousand times sweeter and
more glorious than that of a mercenary?

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Dulce et decorum pro patria mori.<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a><br /></span>
</span></span>

Yet his soul was agitated. Those smiling fields he
loved so well, those graceful banks of the lake and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
river, those mountains where the setting sun fired the
everlasting snows, those friends whose idol he was,
his country above all, and the liberty which he desired
to win for her ... all these images rose before him in
his prison, and deeply stirred his heart. But he soon
returned to calmer thoughts. He hoped that his death
would lead to the deliverance of Geneva, and then his
courage returned. Yet he was without bravado, and
to the soldiers around him he showed only a simple
and candid soul. His little favourite animal still
played in his bosom; surprised at everything about it,
the weasel at the least noise would prick up its short
wide ears. Berthelier smiled and caressed it. ‘The
better to mock his guards,’ says the prior of St. Victor,
‘he played with his weasel.’<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">264</a> Bonivard, inclined to
take things by the wrong side, saw mockery where
there was only good-nature. In fact, the guards,
rough and violent men, touched by so much patience
and courage, said to Berthelier: ‘Ask my lord’s pardon.’&mdash;‘What
lord’s?’&mdash;‘My lord duke of Savoy,
your prince and ours.’&mdash;‘He is not my prince,’ he said,
‘and if he were, I would not ask for pardon, because
I have done no wrong. It is the wicked who should
beg for pardon, and not the good.’&mdash;‘He will put you
to death, then,’ said the guards. Berthelier made no
reply. But a few minutes after, he went up to the
wall and wrote: ‘<i>Non moriar sed vivam et narrabo
opera Domini</i>&mdash;I shall not die but live and declare
the works of the Lord.’ This quotation from the hundred
and eighteenth Psalm, where the Messiah speaks
by the mouth of David, shows that Berthelier possessed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
a certain knowledge of Scripture; perhaps it shows
us, too, that his soul had cast all its burdens on the
Lord.<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a></p>

<p>At that time (1519), when christians, trusting in
the Bible, were rising at Wittemberg against absolute
power in spiritual things, citizens trusting in
the ancient charters of liberty were rising at Geneva
against absolute power in temporal things. At that
time there was no fusion of these two principles.
Perhaps Luther did not become liberal; Berthelier
certainly did not become protestant. But in the
presence of death this great citizen sought consolation
in the Word of God and not in the ceremonies of the
priest, which is the essence of protestantism. The
passage he wrote on the wall has reference to the
Saviour’s resurrection. Did Berthelier find in this
transformation of the King of believers a solid reason
for expecting for himself a resurrection, a glorious
transformation? Did he hope, after this world, for a
glorified world of imperishable felicity, the everlasting
abode of the children of God?&mdash;We believe so.

<span class="small">PHILIBERT BERTHELIER THE MARTYR OF LIBERTY. TERROR AND
OPPRESSION IN GENEVA.<br />

(<span class="smcap">August and September 1519.</span>)</span></h2>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> prisoner was soon diverted from these wholesome
thoughts by the arrival of the officers of
justice. According to the privileges of Geneva, he
could only be tried by the syndics; but the bastard
suspected this lawful tribunal, and finding no honest
man that would undertake to act against the law,
he issued a provost’s commission to Jean Desbois, a
man of Chamb&eacute;ry, then living at Geneva, and ‘formerly
a tooth-drawer,’ say contemporary documents. This
extemporised judge, vain of his functions, wished to
begin the examination. ‘When the syndics, who are
my judges, question me, I will answer them,’ said
Berthelier, ‘but not you, who have no right to do so.’&mdash;‘I
shall come again,’ said Desbois after this futile
attempt, ‘and shall compel you to answer me then.’
The provost went and reported to the bishop the
unsatisfactory commencement of his high functions.<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a></p>

<p>The emotion was universal in Geneva. The friend
of its liberties, the founder of the league <i>Who touches</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
<i>one touches all</i>, was about to pay with his life for his
enthusiasm in the cause of independence. The bold
spirits, who braved the papal tyrant, proposed that
they should consider this act of the bishop’s as mere
brigandage (which it was in fact), and that they should
support the laws by rescuing Berthelier. But the
magistrates preferred a more moderate course. The
Great Council was hastily assembled, and at their
order the syndics waited upon the bishop. ‘My
lord,’ said they, ‘Berthelier has been acquitted according
to law; and now he is arrested without accuser,
and without a preliminary information. If he is
innocent, let him be set at liberty; if he is guilty, let
him be tried by us; do not permit an infringement of
the franchises in your city.’&mdash;‘It is true there is no
accuser,’ said the bishop, ‘but common rumour stands
in his stead; there is no preliminary information, but
the notoriety of the deed supplies its place; as for what
judges it concerns, the injury having been committed
against the prince, it is the business of his officers to
prosecute.’ Having thus dragged the sheep into his
den, the wolf would not let it go.<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a></p>

<p>When they were informed of this denial of justice,
the more energetic party protested loudly. They asked
if there was any duty more sacred than to deliver
innocence? Could the people see with indifference
the rights which belonged to them from time immemorial
trodden under foot by a prince who had sworn
to defend them? The bishop and his creatures, fearing
lest the storm should burst, resolved to put the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
rebel speedily out of the way. The proceedings did
not last two days, as Bonivard writes; all was done
in one (August 23) between six and seven in the
morning and four in the afternoon.<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">268</a> Berthelier saw
what was preparing, but his calmness never failed
him. He remembered that, according to the sages of
antiquity, the voluntary sacrifice which men make of
their lives, out of love for their fellow-countrymen,
has a mysterious power to save them. Had this not
been seen among the Greeks and the Romans? And
among those very leaguers whom Berthelier had so
loved, was it not by thrusting the lances of the
enemy into his bosom that Arnold of Winkelried delivered
Switzerland?... But if Berthelier desired to
save Geneva, Geneva desired to save him. Good men,
the friends of right and maintainers of the sworn
franchises of the citizens, felt that the ancient laws of
the State deserved more respect than the despotic will
of a perjured and cruel prince. The castle where
the liberator was confined (a private possession of the
house of Savoy) had long since been put into a condition
to resist surprise; but Champel, the usual place
of execution, was at a little distance from the city;
the moment when Berthelier was conducted there
would be the favourable opportunity. He will hardly
have taken a hundred steps beyond the bridge when
the huguenots, rising like one man and issuing from
every quarter, will rescue him from the executioners
who are nothing but murderers before the laws of
men and the justice of God.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span></p>

<p>These rumours reached the ears of the bastard,
who took his measures accordingly. Six hundred
men-at-arms were drawn out, and all the mamelukes
joined them. The vidame posted a detachment on
the side of St. Gervais (right bank) to cut off the
inhabitants of the faubourg from all access to the
island; he stationed the greater part ‘under arms and
in line of battle’ along the left bank, so as to occupy
the bridge, the Rue du Rhone, and the cross streets.
Among the Savoyard captains who gave the sanction
of their presence to this legal murder was Fran&ccedil;ois
de Ternier, seignior of Pontverre, a violent and energetic
man and yet of a generous disposition. The
blood of Berthelier, which was about to be shed,
excited a thirst in his heart which the blood of the
huguenots alone could quench; from that hour Pontverre
was the deadliest enemy of Geneva and the
Genevans. But (as pagan antiquity would have said)
the terrible Nemesis, daughter of Jupiter and Night,
goddess of vengeance and retribution, holding a sword
in one hand and a torch in the other, was one day to
overtake him, a few steps only from the spot where
the blood of Berthelier was about to flow, and divine
justice commissioned to punish crime would avenge
this unjust death in his own blood.<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a></p>

<p>All was ready. Desbois entered the prison with
a confessor and the headsman. ‘I summon you a
second time to answer,’ said he to Berthelier. The
noble citizen refused. ‘I summon you a third time,’
repeated the ex-dentist, ‘under pain of losing your
head.’ Berthelier answered not a word: he would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
reply only to his lawful judges, the syndics. He
knew, besides, that these appeals were empty forms,
that he was not a defendant but a victim. Then,
without other formality, the provost pronounced sentence:
‘Philibert Berthelier, seeing that thou hast
always been rebellious against our most dread lord
and thine, we condemn thee to have thy head cut off
to the separation of the soul from the body; thy body
to be hung to the gibbet at Champel, thy head to be
nailed to the gallows near the river Arve, and thy
goods confiscated to the prince.’ The provost then
introduced the confessor, ‘with whom Berthelier did
not hold long discourse.’ After that the third personage,
the headsman, came forward and pinioned
him.<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">270</a></p>

<p>In every quarter of Geneva men’s eyes were fixed
on the Ch&acirc;teau de l’Ile. Its old gates fell back, the
guards marched out first, the provost came next,
followed by the headsman holding Berthelier. The
martyr’s countenance proclaimed the greatness of his
soul. There was and still is, between the castle and
the river, a narrow space so protected by the Rhone
and the fortress, that fifty men could hold it against
all the inhabitants of Geneva. The prince-bishop, so
learned in the art of tyranny, was not ignorant that
if the victim to be sacrificed is loved by the people,
the death-blow must be given in prison, in a court-yard,
on a narrow beach, or in a castle moat. Berthelier
having advanced a few steps found himself
between the ch&acirc;teau and the river. ‘Say thy prayers,’
said the provost. The hero knew he was about to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
be murdered: he made ‘a short prayer,’ and, rising
from his knees, was preparing ‘to utter a few words
before dying,’ to give a last testimony to the liberties
of Geneva; but the provost would not permit him.
Turning to the executioner, he said: ‘Make haste
with your work.’&mdash;‘Kneel down,’ said the man to his
victim. Then Berthelier, whether he desired to express
his sorrow at the gloomy future of his fellow-citizens,
or was moved at seeing himself sacrificed
and none of his friends appearing to defend him,
exclaimed as he fell on his knees: ‘Ah!... Messieurs
of Geneva’ ... It was all he said; he had no sooner
uttered the words ‘than the executioner cut off his
head: it was the 23rd of August, 1519.’ The bishop
had managed matters well. That cruel man was more
like the wild beast that devours the flock than the
shepherd who protects them; he had shown himself
truly <i>tremend&aelig; velocitatis animal</i>, ‘an animal of terrible
swiftness,’ as Pliny says of the tiger; but unlike
that animal, he was cowardly as well as cruel. The
Genevans, whose father he should have been, turned
from him with horror, and the avenging angel of the
innocent prepared to visit him with a terrible retribution
at his death. Vainly would the waters of the
Rhone flow for ages over this narrow space&mdash;there
are stains of blood that no waters can ever wash out.<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a></p>

<p>The bishop intended, however, that Berthelier
should be conveyed to the place of execution for
criminals; he only found it more prudent to have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
him taken thither dead than alive, being sure that in
this way the ‘youths of Geneva’ could not restore him
to liberty. The lifeless body of the martyr was placed
on a waggon; the executioner got in and stood beside
it, holding the victim’s head in his hand. A universal
horror fell upon the people, and many, heartbroken
at being unable to save their friend, shut themselves
up in their houses to veil their hatred and their
shame. The long procession, starting from the castle,
moved forward, preceded and closed by foreign soldiers;
in the middle was the waggon bearing the
dead body, and close behind followed many mamelukes,
‘not the least of their party, in great insolence,
mocking at their own calamity; but good men dared
not breathe, seeing that when force reigns, the good
cause must keep still.’<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">272</a> A few huguenots, however,
mournful and indignant, appeared in the streets or
at their doors. Meanwhile the executioner, parading
in his triumphal car, swung derisively to and fro the
martyr’s bleeding head, and cried: ‘This is the head
of the traitor Berthelier: let all take warning by it.’
The procession continued its march as far as Champel,
where the executioner suspended the body of the father
of Genevese liberty to the gibbet. Thence, by a
singular refinement of cruelty, they proceeded to the
bridge of Arve, and the head of the dead man, who
had so often terrified the bishop, was fastened up in
the place where those of Blanchet and Navis had hung
so long. The prelate seemed to take pleasure in reviving
the recollection of his former butcheries.</p>

<p>Thus that kind-hearted man whom everybody
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
loved, that heroic citizen around whom were concentrated
all the hopes of the friends of liberty, had
been sacrificed by his bishop. That death so hurried,
so illegal, so tragical, filled the Genevans with horror.
The fate of his widow and children moved them; but
that of Geneva moved them more profoundly still.
Berthelier had fallen a victim to his passion for his
country; and that passion, which made many other
hearts beat high, drew tears even from the most
selfish. The body hanging from the gibbet, the head
nailed up near the bridge of Arve, the memory of
that sad procession, did not speak to the senses only;
men’s hearts were rent as if by a violent blow, and
many refused all consolation. There were also
some proud firm spirits who, unable to weep, gave
vent to maledictions. They might be met silent and
frowning in the streets, and their air, the tone of their
voice, their gait, their ironical and bitter words, expressed
an indescribable contempt for the murderers.
They retraced in their minds that strange struggle,
between cruel princes and a generous, simple-minded,
poor but free man. On one side were the splendours
of the throne, the majesty of the priesthood, armies,
executioners, tortures, scaffolds, and all the terrors of
power; on the other, a humble man, opposing his
enemies by the nobleness of his character and the
unshrinking firmness of his courage.... The combat
was unequal, and the head of the great citizen had
fallen. A bishop looked with an ecstasy of joy on the
blood of one of his flock, in which he bathed his feet
while impudently violating all the laws of the country.
But&mdash;and it was the consolation of these proud
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
citizens&mdash;the blood that had been shed would awaken
a terrible voice. Outraged justice and bleeding
liberty would utter a long and mournful cry, which
would reach the ears of the Swiss League. Then
would mountain and valley, castle and cottage, city
and hamlet, and every echo of the Alps repeat it one
to another, and thousands of arms would one day
unite to defend that little city so unworthily oppressed.<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">273</a></p>

<p>Berthelier’s death was to have still more serious
consequences. His enemies had hoped to stifle liberty
by killing him. Perhaps ... but it was one of those
deaths which are followed by a glorious resurrection.
In the battle which had just been fought noble blood
had been spilt, but it was blood that leads to victory
at last. <i>Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground
and die, it abideth alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth
much fruit.</i> Religious liberty had many victims three
centuries ago in all the countries of the Reformation;
but the noblest martyrs of political liberty, in modern
times, have fallen at Geneva (if my judgment does
not mislead me), and their death has not been useless
to the universal cause of civilisation. <i>Cruciate, torquete,
damnate ... sanguis christianorum, semen.</i> The
blood of the martyrs is a seed&mdash;a seed which takes
root and bears fruit, not only in the spot where it has
been sown, but in many other parts of the world.</p>

<p>Berthelier’s friends were struck by his contempt of
death and assurance of eternal life. They still seemed
to hear the noble testimony he had borne to immortality.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
Hence one of them wrote this noble epitaph
for him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Quid mihi mors nocuit? Virtus post fata virescit;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nec cruce nec gladio s&aelig;vi perit illa tyranni.<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">274</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As we see, the idea of a resurrection, of a life after
death, over which man has no power, seems to have
been uppermost in the mind of Berthelier as well as
of his friends. This man was not a common martyr
of liberty.</p>

<p>‘Verily,’ said some, ‘the maxim lately set forth is
a true one: Heroes and the founders of republics and
empires have, next to God, the greatest right to the
adoration of men.’<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">275</a></p>

<p>The bishop hastened to take advantage of his victory.
‘Berthelier’s death,’ said his friend Bonivard,
‘gives the tyrant great comfort, for the watch-dog
being killed, he can easily manage the scattered sheep.’
The bishop began, therefore, to move onwards, and
undertook to revolutionise Geneva. At first he resolved
to change the magistrature. Four days after
the execution he assembled the general council, and,
assuming the airs of a conqueror, appeared at it with
a numerous train. ‘We John of Savoy,’ said he in
the document which has been preserved, ‘bishop and
prince of Geneva, being informed of the dissensions
of this city, have not feared to come hither at great
expense to administer by force of arms the most effectual
remedy; and we have behaved like a good shepherd.
My lord the Duke of Savoy, who singularly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
loves this city, having desired to enter it, the syndics
and the seditious have with incredible annoyance rebelled
against a prince so gentle;<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">276</a> and if this illustrious
prince had not been touched with compassion,
if he had not surpassed by his clemency the charity
of the Redeemer<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">277</a> ... we should all have been destroyed.’
After these strange words from a bishop,
who placed the duke above Jesus Christ, at the very
time when this prince had made himself the accomplice
in a murder, Master Chappuis, the official, called
out: ‘Say is it not so?’ None but mamelukes were
present at the assembly, and among them several
persons who had no right to be there. Many voices
shouted, ‘Yes, yes!’ for it was then the reign of
terror. The syndics, ‘more ready to yield the bishop
their maces than their heads,’ says Bonivard, laid
down before him the insignia of their office. The next
day another general council elected four mameluke
syndics: P. Versonay, P. Montyon, P. de Fernex,
and G. Danel, ‘who everywhere and in everything did
what the bishop and the duke desired.’ The same
day, all huguenots were excluded from the two councils;
and the bishop forbade the citizens to carry arms
or to assemble by night, under penalty of a fine of
twenty-five livres and ten stripes of the cord.</p>

<p>Sorrow and dismay filled men’s hearts. Geneva
lay as it were under one of those funeral palls which
are stretched over the dead. No one stirred out, no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
one spoke; all was motionless and silent; the air of
despotism could be felt, as it hung over and benumbed
the soul. Besan&ccedil;on Hugues, A. L&eacute;vrier, and the
other patriots retired to their homes; but they had
not lost hope; they waited in silence until God should
make the cause of liberty to triumph again in their
country.<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">278</a> Erelong, however, a few courageous
spirits awoke and began to stir. The patriots felt
the need of pouring out their sorrows together; and
it was told the bishop ‘that several persons of the
huguenot sect<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">279</a> were in the habit of meeting secretly
in various places.’ Then the persecutions began
afresh: ‘They spared the good as little as the bad,’
says Bonivard, ‘and accused them of false crimes to
be revenged on them.’</p>

<p>A short time before the period we are describing,
Amadeus de Joye, one of Berthelier’s friends, had
committed an act of little importance in itself, but
which was the first sign of opposition in Geneva to
the Romish superstitions. Two years earlier Luther
had written to Spenlein his beautiful letter on
justification by faith; he had expounded the epistle
to the Galatians, and probably posted up his theses.
Zwingle, who had been appointed preacher at Einsiedeln,
was declaiming against pilgrimages, offerings,
images, and the invocation of the Virgin and the
saints. Had the report of these sermons reached
Geneva? It is possible, for, as we have seen, there
was constant intercourse between this city and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
German cantons. However that may be, many Genevans
were already asking if the glory of God ‘was
not defiled by so foolish and lifeless a thing as an
image?’ Amadeus de Joye, whom we have met before
at the Molard assembly, and whom his enemies
accused of being the friend of Berthelier, P&eacute;colat,
‘and many other villains,’ felt little respect for the
bishop’s <i>dolls</i>. Now there was at Geneva a famous
black image of wood, between two and three feet
high, called St. Babolin. Certain catholics held it
in great devotion, carrying it in long processions, and
rendering it every sort of honour. One night when
the worshippers of St. Babolin had assembled in the
house of Ami Motey, one of their number, De Joye,
indignant at their idolatry and thinking the ugly
figure was more like a devil than a god, carried it
off, and, with the intention of giving a lesson to the
partisans of the idol, took it to Motey’s house. The
window was open; he listened to the conversation of
this devout little circle, and taking courage raised the
image as high as the casement and flung it into the
midst of its worshippers. It must be acknowledged
that this was not controversy of the right sort; but it
was the sixteenth century, and the Genevans were of a
bold and scoffing humour. The startled followers of
Babolin looked with astonishment at their saint, which
appeared to have fallen from heaven. All of a sudden
the door was opened and a loud voice called out: ‘It is
the devil ... he will eat you all!’ At these words,
Motey jumped up, caught hold of a javelin and prepared
to hurl it at the intruder; but De Joye hastily retired.
There were no blows given, and no blood was shed.<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">280</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span></p>

<p>This incident had been almost forgotten, when the
bishop’s agents, who were resolved to be severe upon
the friends of liberty, shut up De Joye in the Ch&acirc;teau
de l’Ile, where Berthelier had been imprisoned, and
asked the syndics’ permission to question and to torture
him in order to get at the truth (7th September,
1519). Besides this affair of the image, he was
charged with ‘having been present at illegal meetings
where the citizens bound themselves by oath to resist
any infringement of their liberties by word or by
deed.’<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">281</a> The syndics ordered that De Joye should be
examined in prison, <i>pede ligato</i>, with the feet bound.
The proceedings commenced.</p>

<p>‘I was born of worthy, upright, and distinguished
parents,’ said De Joye when he appeared before the
syndics, ‘and by them trained up virtuously until the
age of manhood. Since then I have associated with
all the good men of the city, and in the profession
which I follow I have always borne a good reputation.
Far from picking quarrels, I have carefully avoided
them, and have reconciled many. Finally, I have
been all my life faithful and obedient to my lord the
bishop.’<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">282</a> These words, which we transcribe from the
documents in the trial, were of a nature to inspire
the judges with a certain respect; but they did not.
First Claude du Bois, the vidame’s lieutenant, and
next the governor of the castle, proposed that De Joye
should be put to the torture to force him to confess the
crimes imputed to him;<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">283</a> but it was decided to begin by
examining the witnesses, who told what they had <i>heard</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
<i>say</i> by persons <i>whose names they could not remember</i>.
Fine evidence on which to put a man to the torture!<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">284</a>
The governor did not abandon his project; the vidame
came in person to urge the syndics to <i>do him
this pleasure</i>.<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">285</a> Could they be denied, when it concerned
only a contemner of St. Babolin? Amadeus
knew not the Gospel; his opposition to the black image
proceeded merely from the disgust which superstition
inspires in intelligent minds, and there was in his
character more fire than firmness, more impetuosity
than perseverance. The mild, weak, and infirm man,
who was scared by the idea of torture, fancied his limbs
already dislocated, and beginning to weep he offered to
make oath of his innocence on the relics of St. Anthony.
To all the questions put to him he replied only by
groans and tears. The vidame, whose heart was
hardened, again demanded that he should be put to
the torture. ‘My right arm is crippled,’ exclaimed
the poor wretch; ‘the sinews are contracted.’ Two
surgeons declared, after examination, that he might be
able to bear the strappado, but could not support the
torture of the <i>chatte</i> without fainting.<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">286</a> There were
in the executioner’s list punishments for all temperaments,
for the sick and crippled as well as for the
strong. De Joye, who, after he had sown his wild
oats, had become a respectable citizen, was neither
a hero nor a revolutionist. The embarrassed judges,
not finding sufficient cause in the Babolin joke to
put a man to death, helped him to escape during the
night, and so saved appearances. The persecutions
of the bishop were not limited to a single individual.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
John of Savoy took delight in power, and wished to
show the cardinals that he was strong enough to put
down revolt. ‘They imprisoned,’ says Bonivard,
‘they beat, they tortured, they beheaded and hanged,
so that it was quite pitiful.’<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">287</a> Geneva was crushed.</p>

<p>As it was not enough to lay their hands upon men,
the princes of Savoy laid their hands upon the constitution.
War was made against principles still more
than against persons. It was necessary to stifle those
strange aspirations which carried men’s minds towards
new ideas, and to put an end to imaginations which
denied the lawfulness of absolute power. The duke, in
accord with the bishop, published, although he was
a foreign prince, an act restricting the liberties of
Geneva, which banished from the general council all
young men (for they were suspected of independence),
and deprived the people of the direct election of syndics.
On the 3rd of September, the general council, at
which few but mamelukes were present, accepted these
articles in silence. Thus did the Duke of Savoy, with
the bishop’s help, triumph over principles, rights, and
liberties, and think he had strangled in their nest the
young eagles whom he had once feared to see soaring
into the heavens. Geneva, humbled and silenced by
a bad prince and a maimed constitution, was no longer
to be feared.</p>

<p>The sorrow was general, and it might have been
supposed that the community only possessed strength
enough to yield its last breath. But as was seen
formerly in Israel, in moments of crisis, how prophets
and prophetesses arose, so voices were heard in Geneva&mdash;voices
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
of the weakest creatures&mdash;proclaiming the
ruin of the people and denouncing the awful judgments
of God. A poor girl for three days walked up
and down the city, neither eating nor drinking, but
crying everywhere as she went: <i>Le maz mugnier!
le maz molin! le maz molu! ... tout est perdu.</i>
‘Wicked miller! wicked mill! wicked meal!....
All is lost!’ The miller was the prince, the mill
was the constitution, the meal was the people.... It
seems that this monotonous and doleful voice affected
everybody, even the mamelukes; the world readily
believed in the marvellous in those days; and the
vidame dared not arrest the prophetess. Syndic
Balard, one of the most enlightened men in Geneva
at that time, saw a deep meaning in the poor girl’s
mission.<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">288</a>

(1520-1523.)</span></h2>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> prophetess was mistaken: the <i>meal</i> was good.
On a sudden the sky hitherto so dark cleared up,
and there was a gleam of sunshine. The duke, who
was thinking of marriage, returned to Turin; the
bishop, who was seriously ill and needed a warmer
air, withdrew to his abbey of Pignerol, and the huguenots,
freed from their two oppressors, raised their
heads. Ramel, Hugues, Taccon, Baudichon de la
Maison-Neuve, and two others, waited upon the episcopal
vicar, prothonotary of the holy see, and demanded
the revocation of the decrees contrary to the
liberties of the city, and the liberation of all citizens
imprisoned by the bishop. ‘In case of refusal,’ they
said, ‘we shall appeal to the metropolitan see of
Vienne.’<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">289</a> The vicar, remembering the excommunication
incurred in the affair of P&eacute;colat, was alarmed,
and granted all they demanded. This concession
raised the courage of the most timid, and the patriots
immediately held meetings to provide for the safety
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
of the city. Aim&eacute; L&eacute;vrier, the judge, was especially
prominent. Berthelier had been the man of action,
L&eacute;vrier was the man of right: he had seen with
sorrow force substituted for law. In his opinion,
every idea hostile to right ought to be combated;
and the government of the bishop was not that of the
laws, but of arbitrary power and terrorism. L&eacute;vrier
had examples in his own family: the prelate had
caused his brother-in-law (the procurator Chambet)
to be thrown into prison because he was a huguenot,
and to be tortured so severely that his limbs remained
out of joint. ‘God made man free,’ said L&eacute;vrier,
‘ages have made Geneva free; no prince has the right
to make us slaves.’ Despairing of ever seeing the
bishop reign with justice, he proposed an effectual
remedy: ‘Let us petition the pope for the prelate’s
destitution.’ The daring motion was agreed to, and
L&eacute;vrier was commissioned to go to Rome to see to its
execution. The princes of Savoy succeeded in stopping
him, and parried the blow, in part at least.
Leo X., however, acknowledging how shameful the
bishop’s conduct had been, ordered the bastard never
to return to Geneva, and to select a coadjutor to replace
him. This was a cruel disgrace to the prelate.</p>

<p>Nor was this all: the people reasserted their ancient
rights. The time had come for electing the
syndics for the year; the duke and the bishop, as it
will be remembered, had deprived the citizens of the
right to elect, and accordingly the Great Council
nominated these magistrates; but immediately loud
protests were heard. The aged John Favre<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">290</a> and his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
two sons, with De la Mare, Malbuisson, Vandel,
Richardet, and others, protested vigorously against
this illegal act, and declared that the election ought
to take place according to the ancient franchises.
The people were at that time assembled in general
council. The mamelukes, unwilling to restore the
liberties which their chiefs had taken away from the
citizens, resisted stoutly; and there was an immense
uproar in the assembly. The huguenots, ever prompt,
immediately organised the bureau, not troubling themselves
about the protests of their adversaries, and the
popular elections began. At this news the ministers
of the bishop and the duke hurried to the council,
exclaiming: ‘Stop! it is a great scandal; the Great
Council has already named the syndics!’ The huguenots
resisted; they declared they would resume
the ancient privileges of which a foreign prince had
deprived them; and the ministers of the two cousins
(Charles and John), finding their only resource was
to gain time, demanded and obtained the adjournment
of the election until the morrow. The huguenots
felt themselves too strong not to wait. The next day,
which was Monday, the citizens poured from every
quarter towards St. Pierre’s, full of enthusiasm for the
constitutions handed down by their ancestors. Violence
could not annul right; the election was made
by the people in conformity with the liberties of Geneva.
But the huguenots, having recovered their
liberties, gave a proof of a moderation still more surprising
than their energy. They knew that by being
patient they would be strong; they thought that the
election of huguenot syndics might, under present circumstances,
cause the storm to burst, and bring down
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
incalculable disasters upon the city; they therefore returned
the same syndics as the Great Council had done.
After having conquered absolutism, they conquered
themselves. To construct with haste a scaffolding
that might afterwards be easily thrown down was not
their object; they desired to lay a solid foundation
for the temple of liberty.<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">291</a></p>

<p>They did more: they attempted a reconciliation.
Three of them, headed by Robert Vandel (who was
syndic in 1529), called upon the mameluke syndic
Danel, and said: ‘Let us forget our mutual offences
and make peace; let us drop the names mameluke
and huguenot, and let there be none but Genevans
in Geneva. Bring the matter before the council.’
The huguenots, like true citizens, desired union in
their country; not so the mamelukes, who were sold
to the foreigner. They referred the proposition to the
vicar and episcopal council, and then to the bishop
and the duke&mdash;a sure means of insuring its failure.<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">292</a>
Moderation, concord, respect for the rights of all,
were on the side of liberty. The only thought of the
priests and mamelukes was how to separate themselves
from the public cause. Of this a striking proof was
seen at that time.</p>

<p>Money to pay the expenses of the war (known as
the war <i>des B&eacute;solles</i>) had to be raised. The clergy,
notwithstanding their wealth, refused to pay their
quota, little suspecting that by their avarice they were
preparing the way for the Reformation.<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">293</a> To no purpose
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
did the huguenots, who had shown themselves so
magnanimous in the election of the syndics, make an
earnest movement to reconcile all parties; the priests,
thinking only of their purses, replied by one of those
violent measures customary with the papacy. A citation
from Rome fell suddenly into the midst of
Geneva; the pope summoned the chief magistrates of
the republic to appear before him, to render an account
of the tax they had dared to levy upon the priests; and
on the 30th of April the agents of the court of Rome
posted the citation on the gates of the church of St.
Pierre. The citizens ran up to read it. What! the
priests must always keep themselves apart! Poor
men who gain their living painfully by the sweat of
their brow, must stint their children’s bread in order
to pay this debt; and these debauched monks, these
indolent priests, still abundantly enjoy the delights
of the flesh, and are not willing to make the smallest
sacrifice? The public conscience was stirred, the
city thrilled with indignation, ‘everybody was much
vexed;’ the next day the anger excited by this
new act of meanness, this crying selfishness, burst out,
and ‘there was some rioting.’</p>

<p>Had the Reformation anything to do with this opposition
to the selfishness of the priests and the despotism
of Rome? It is possible, nay, probable; but
it is a mistake to mix up the Reformer of Wittemberg
with it. ‘Luther,’ says Bonivard, ‘had already
given instruction at this time to many in Geneva and
elsewhere.’<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">294</a> The <i>instruction</i>, mentioned by the prior
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
of St. Victor, clearly refers to christian truth in general,
and not to the conduct of the Genevese under
present circumstances. Had Luther done more?
Had he addressed to Geneva any of his evangelical
teachings, as Bonivard seems to indicate? Had he
begun in this city the work that Calvin completed, as
one of Bonivard’s editors thinks?<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">295</a> This seems to
us more than doubtful. The influence exercised by
Luther over Geneva is indisputable; but it proceeded
solely from his writings; it was the general influence
of the evangelical ideas scattered through the world
by the great Reformer.</p>

<p>It was the year 1520. Luther was known at
Geneva. A few huguenots, indignant at the bull
from Rome, asked whether this monk, who was already
spoken of throughout christendom, had not
shown that the pope had been often mistaken, and
was mistaken every day? When the pope had condemned
him, had not Luther appealed from the
pope? Had he not said that the power of the sovereign
pastor ought not to be employed in murdering
‘Christ’s lambs and throwing them into the jaws of
the wolf?’ ... When the pope had launched a bull
against this bold doctor, as he now launched a citation
against Geneva, had not Luther asked how it
was that you could not find in all the Bible one word
about the papacy, and that while the Scriptures often
mention little things, they positively say nothing of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
what we are assured are the greatest in the church?<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">296</a> ...
‘We are no longer so frightened at the pope’s
bells,’ said the Genevans, ‘and will not let ourselves
be caught in his nets.’<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">297</a> Such was the first echo in
Geneva of the cry uttered at Wittemberg. On those
hills which rise so gracefully at the extremity of that
beautiful lake, there was a soil ready to receive the
seed which Luther was scattering in the air. It came
borne on the winds from the banks of the Elbe even
to the banks of the Rhone. Geneva and Wittemberg
began to shake hands.</p>

<p>The Genevan priests, hearing the name of Luther,
were alarmed; they fancied they already saw the
dreaded face of the arch-heretic in Geneva, and began
to make long processions to avert the wrath of heaven.
One day, wishing at any cost to save their
purses and their faith, they organised a procession on
a greater scale than usual. Issuing from the city
they proceeded with loud chants towards Our Lady
of Grace on the bank of the impetuous torrent of
Arve, whose turbid waters descend from the glaciers.
All were there&mdash;canons, priests, monks, scholars in
white surplices, while clerks, proud of their office,
bore in front the image of St. Peter, the symbol of
the papacy. The spectacle was very displeasing to
the townspeople. If, they thought, we can do without
the pope, like Luther, may we not also do without
these canons, monks, and priests? Has not Luther
said that ‘a christian elected by christians to preach
the Gospel is more truly a priest than if all the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
bishops and popes had consecrated him?’<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">298</a> It is
scarcely probable that the Genevans would have had
the idea of putting into practice this theory of the Reformer;
but some of them desired to get quit of this
army of Rome, in the pay of the Duke of Savoy. ‘All
the priests have gone out,’ said they; ‘let us profit by
the opportunity to shut the gates of the city, and prevent
them from returning!’ As the priests placed
their interests in opposition to those of the city, it
seemed logical to put them quietly out of Geneva.
‘All those black coats,’ says Syndic Roset, ‘were very
nearly shut out, through separating themselves from
the republic.’<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">299</a> We may imagine the fright of the
priests when they learnt what had been proposed.
There was nothing, they thought, of which these
huguenots were not capable, and such an off-hand way
of getting rid of the clergy at one stroke was very
much in keeping with their character. The citizens
were not however bold enough for this. ‘The prudent
averted that,’ says Bonivard. The startled monks
and priests returned hastily and without opposition
to their nests, and lived once more at their ease:
they escaped with a good fright. This strange
proposal, made by a few men of decision, has been
considered a prelude to the Reformation in Geneva.
That is saying too much; it required the Gospel to be
first preached in the city: and that was the real prelude.
The hour of the Reformation had not yet
come; still the lesson was not lost, and an arrangement
was made with the clergy, who paid a portion
of the expenses of the war.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span></p>

<p>Other events gave some hope to the Genevans,
whose franchises were so rudely trodden under foot;
their greatest friend came out of prison, and their
greatest enemy quitted this world. Bonivard was
still in confinement, but his relations, who had great
influence at court, solicited the duke to restore him
to liberty. ‘I dare not,’ said Charles, ‘for fear of
offending the pope.’ They then applied to Rome:
Leo X. commissioned the Bishop of Belley to investigate
the matter, and the friends of the prior entreated
this prelate to set the prisoner at large: ‘I dare not,’
he replied, ‘for fear of offending the duke.’ At
last the duke consented, and Bonivard recovered his
liberty but not his priory. The Abbot of Montheron,
to whom Charles had given it, having gone to Rome
to arrange his affairs, was invited by certain ecclesiastics
who coveted his benefice to a banquet ‘after the
Roman manner, and there,’ says Bonivard, ‘they
gave him some cardinals’ powder, which purged the
soul out of his body.’<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">300</a> It was by having recourse
to this ‘romanesque’ fashion that the guilty soul
of Pope Alexander VI. had been hurried from the
world. A deed was found by which the repentant
Montheron resigned to Bonivard whatever rights he
had over the priory;<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">301</a> but Leo X. gave St. Victor to
one of his cousins, who leased the revenue for 640
gold crowns; and Bonivard, the amiable and brilliant
gentleman, brought up in abundance, at one time prior
and even prince, was left in poverty. It is true that
he succeeded for a time in being put in possession of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
his priory; but the duke soon made him regret in a
horrible dungeon the liberty and goods that had been
restored to him. Geneva’s day of agony was not yet
ended, and at the very time when the citizens hoped
to be able to breathe a purer air, oppression once more
came and stifled them.</p>

<p>Another event which seemed likely to be favourable
to Geneva was approaching. The pope, as we have
said, had forced a coadjutor upon the bishop, and the
latter had chosen Pierre de la Baume, an ecclesiastic
of high family, a scion of the illustrious house of the
counts of Montrevel, whom he looked upon as a son.
Pierre, who was abbot of Suze and St. Claude, and
bishop of Tarsus <i>in partibus</i>, came to Geneva about
the time of Bonivard’s liberation in 1521 to take possession
of his charge. On the 25th of January a <i>Te
Deum</i> was sung for that purpose at St. Pierre’s by
the Bishop of Maurienne. Everybody knew that the
coadjutor would soon be bishop and prince; accordingly
all passions were aroused, and after mass, the
mamelukes endeavoured to gain over the future
bishop to their side. Besan&ccedil;on Hugues, who desired
to see Geneva catholic and episcopal, but free, waited
upon the prelate; reminded him, to pave the way for
a good reception, that one Hugues, his great-uncle,
had been cardinal, and perceiving that he had to deal
with a frivolous, vain, pleasure-seeking man, and who,
as a younger son, was ambitious to rise at least as high
as his elder brothers, he strove to make him understand
that, far from submitting to the duke, he should remember
that the Bishop of Geneva was <i>prince</i>, while
the duke was only vassal. Pierre de la Baume, a
weak man, ever halting between two opinions, carried
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
away by the honesty and eloquence of the Genevan
citizen, gave him his confidence. Besan&ccedil;on Hugues
remained ever after his most confidential adviser.<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">302</a></p>

<p>Erelong another scene was enacted beyond the
Alps. The miserable John of Savoy lay at Pignerol
on his death-bed. Given during his life to the pleasures
of the table and of debauchery, he was now
paying the penalty of his misdeeds. He suffered
from the gout, he was covered with filthy ulcers, he
was little more than skin and bone. He had thought
only of enjoying life and oppressing others; he had
plotted the ruin of a city of which he should have been
the pastor; he now received the wages of his iniquity.
Near the bed where this prelate lay languishing stood
his coadjutor, who had hastened from Geneva to Pignerol.
With eyes fixed upon the dying man, Pierre sought
to buoy him up with false hopes; but John was not
to be deceived. Soon the dreaded moment approached;
an historian, whom Romish writers quote
habitually with favour,<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">303</a> describes all that was horrible
in the end of this great sinner. Hirelings surrounded
the dying bishop, and turned their eyes from time to
time on him and on the objects they might be able to
carry off as soon as he was insensible. Pierre de la
Baume contemplated the progress of the disease
with ill-dissembled satisfaction, eagerly anticipating
the moment when, relieved from his hypocritical
cares, he would enter into possession of all that he
had coveted for so many years. Jean Portier, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
dying man’s secretary, the confidant of his successor,
watched that criminal impatience, that sordid cupidity,
and that perverse meanness, which he already hoped
to turn to his advantage. The shadows of the victims
of the expiring man were traced on the walls of the
room by an avenging hand, and when at last the
priests desired to administer extreme unction, he
imagined they were covering him with blood. They
presented him the crucifix; he seemed to recognise
the features of Berthelier, and asked with a wild
look: ‘Who has done that?’ Far from embracing
with respect and submission this emblem of eternal
salvation, he rejected it with horror, heaping foul
abuses on it. Blasphemy and insult mingled with the
foam that whitened his trembling lips. Thus wrote an
author less Romanist, we perceive, than is imagined.<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">304</a>
Repentance succeeded despair in the guilty soul of
the prelate before his death. Turning a last look on
his adopted son, he said to him: ‘I wished to give
the principality of Geneva to Savoy ... and to attain
my object, I have put many innocent persons to
death.’ The blood that he had shed cried in his ears:
Navis, Blanchet, and Berthelier rose up before him.
Pursued by remorse, weighed down by the fear of a
Judge, he would have desired to save La Baume from
the faults he had committed himself. ‘If you obtain
this bishopric,’ continued he, ‘I entreat you not to
tread in my footsteps. On the contrary, defend the
franchises of the city.... In the sufferings I endure,
I recognise the vengeance of the Almighty.... I pray
to God for pardon from the bottom of my heart.... In
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
purgatory ... God will pardon me!’<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">305</a> It is gratifying
to hear this cry of an awakening conscience at the
termination of a criminal life. Unfortunately Pierre
de la Baume did not profit by this solemn advice.
The bastard died after horrible sufferings, ‘inflicted
by the divine judgment,’ says Bonivard, ‘and he
went into the presence of the Sovereign to plead with
those whose blood he had shed.’&mdash;‘At the time of his
death, he was so withered,’ adds the prior of St.
Victor, ‘that he did not weigh five and twenty
pounds.’ The prophecy of P&eacute;colat was fulfilled:
<i>Non videbit dies Petri.</i> Instead of twenty-five years
the episcopacy of John of Savoy had only lasted nine.</p>

<p>Geneva was about to change masters. The struggle
which had characterised the episcopacy of John of
Savoy could not fail to be renewed if, instead of a
shepherd, the Genevese received a hireling. Who
would come off victorious in this new combat?
Would the old times be maintained; or, thanks to a
prelate who understood the wants of the age and
the nature of the Gospel, should we witness the commencement
of a new era? There was little hope that
it would be so. The episcopal see of Geneva, which
gave the rank of temporal prince, was much coveted
by nobles, and even, as we have seen, by members of
the sovereign families. These worldly bishops thought
only of getting rich and of living in pomp and pleasure,
careless of the good government of the Church
or of feeding their flock. The thrones of such princes
could not but totter and fall erelong. Pierre de la
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
Baume, certain good qualities notwithstanding, could
not prevent this catastrophe; on the contrary, he
accelerated it. He had wit and imagination; but was
weak, vain, and inclined to the same habits of servility
as his predecessor, ‘incapable,’ says an historian,
‘of comprehending any other happiness than sleeping
well, after he had eaten and drunk well.’<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">306</a></p>

<p>The bastard having breathed his last, Pierre, kneeling
by the side of his bed, rose up a bishop. He took
immediate steps to secure his new property from pillage,
and on the 7th of February, 1522, wrote a letter
to ‘his dearly beloved and trusty syndics, councillors,
citizens, and community of Geneva,’ which gave no
promise that the reign of truth would be witnessed
during his episcopacy. He began with the falsehoods
usual in such cases, and informed the Genevans that
his predecessor had ‘made as holy an end as ever
prelate did, calling upon his Creator and the Virgin
Mary with his latest breath.’ He reminded them at the
same time ‘of the great love and affection which John
had felt while alive for them and for all his good subjects.’ ...
‘Witness the chestnut-tree at the bridge of
Arve,’ said some.<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">307</a></p>

<p>A year elapsed before the new bishop came to
Geneva. Was it from fear; or did his temporal
occupations keep him away? It was probably the
latter motive. He had to come to an understanding
with the duke and the pope touching his episcopacy,
and he visited Rome in order to obtain his briefs.
At last, on the 11th of April, 1523, his solemn entry
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
took place.<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">308</a> A great multitude flocked together
from all the surrounding districts. The syndics, the
councillors, and the people went as far as the bridge
of Arve to meet the bishop, who, accompanied by his
gentlemen, priests and friends, and having by his
side the Countess of Montrevel his sister-in-law, the
Marquis of St. Sorlin his second brother, and two
of his nephews, advanced ‘riding on a mule beautifully
harnessed and gilt, and wearing a green hat, after
the fashion of the bishops of Rome.’ The four syndics
carried a handsome canopy over his head, which
a pelting rain rendered very necessary. ‘More than
a hundred horses crept at a snail’s pace before him.’
Four companies of archers, arquebusiers, bowmen,
and spearmen marched by with firm steps. In every
street of the city ‘young men well mounted, equipped,
and accoutred, rode &agrave; l’albanaise.’ Dramas, farces,
mysteries, games and pastimes were given in the
open air in spite of the rain, and the Genevans were
full of hope. It might have been said that this
branch, so severely shaken and almost separated from
the Roman papacy, was about to be restored. Geneva,
by welcoming the bishop so cordially, seemed to be
welcoming the pope who sent him. This was however
in the year 1523. Luther had burnt the bull
from Rome; he had said before the Diet of Worms,
<i>I cannot do otherwise</i>. The Reformation was advancing
with great strides at Wittemberg, and was spreading
over all Germany. And yet it was just at this
time that Geneva received a Roman bishop almost
with enthusiasm; but if the energetic city should be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
disappointed in its expectations, we shall see it rise
up against all the framework of Rome and overthrow
it without leaving a single piece in its place.</p>

<p>For the moment men indulged in the most flattering
hopes. La Baume bore a tree (in German <i>baum</i>)
on his shield; the Genevese presented him a poem,
the first lines of which ran thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But for this tree which God has planted,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Geneva would have had no gladness;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No branch and no support had I<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To lean upon in time of sadness.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But God be praised for his good work<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In planting here this goodly tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath whose shade the poor shall dwell<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In peace and unity.<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">309</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These verses are a proof of the pacific intentions
which the patriots then entertained; for they were
written by Ami Porral, a most decided huguenot,
who afterwards became one of the first supporters of
the Reformation. The Roman episcopacy did not
correspond to their hopes; Porral and his friends soon
discovered that they must plant <i>another tree in the
orchard</i>, the tree of the Gospel, in whose branches the
birds of the air might come and lodge. A priest representing
St. Peter, and dressed as a pope, presented
to the bishop the golden key of his cathedral, and
the prelate, standing in the church in front of the
high altar, swore to observe the franchises of the city.<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">310</a>
But he had scarcely taken this oath before he imprisoned
a citizen unlawfully; and when the syndics
humbly reminded him of their liberties, he exclaimed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
petulantly: ‘You always smell of the Swiss.’<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">311</a> However,
he set the prisoner at large.</p>

<p>Between 1519 and 1525 there were few days of
energy and enthusiasm in Geneva; her liberty was
expiring, tyranny hovered over the city, a funeral pall
seemed to hang upon its walls. This was a time of
bitter trial and depression in the city. In the midst
of citizens who slumbered, of some who paid court
to an illegitimate power, and of others who thought
of nothing but amusement, there were many who
shed tears over the loss of their glorious hopes. We
feel ill at ease in Geneva now, and still more ill in
the midst of merrymakings than in the midst of trials.
Would the duke and the bishop really succeed in
stifling the new life which animated this little state?
A great event will arise to give strength to liberty.
She descended to the tomb with Berthelier, though
still young; she will come forth again when, the gates
of Switzerland opening wide, Geneva shall grasp the
hand of the ancient champions of independence, and
receive the words of Him who said: <i>The truth shall
make you free</i>.

<span class="small">CHARLES DESIRES TO SEDUCE THE GENEVANS. THE MYSTERIES
OF THE CANONS AND OF THE HUGUENOTS.<br />

(<span class="smcap">August 1523.</span>)</span></h2>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> duke, seeing that the Genevese commune was
seriously weakened, had formed new plans for
definitively seizing the sovereignty, and of expelling
both liberty and the tendencies towards the Reformation,
with which, according to Charles III. and
Charles V., this restless city was infected. Magnificence,
f&ecirc;tes, grandeur, flattery, seduction, and perfidy
were all to be brought into play, and for that end
Charles possessed new resources. He had just married
Beatrice of Portugal, whose sister was about to be
united to the Emperor Charles V. Beatrice, a woman
of great beauty, proud, ambitious, and domineering,
required everything to bend before her; Charles, a
man of no will, found one in this princess; and the
conspiracy of Savoy against Genevan independence
entered into a new phase, which threatened to be
marked by great reverses. After a few months of
wedlock, the duke expressed a desire to present the
beautiful duchess to his good friends of Geneva, and
made preparations for displaying all the pomps and
seductions of a court in order to win them over.
And more than this: the duchess expected to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
brought to bed in December: it was now August
(1523); if she had a boy in Geneva, would not these
worthy burgesses be happy, nay proud, to have for
their prince a son of Savoy born within their walls?
And would not the child’s uncle, the mighty emperor,
have a word to say then in his favour in that ancient
imperial city which still bore the eagle on its shield?
Every means was set to work to carry out this court
manœuvre.</p>

<p>The duke had calculated rightly when reckoning
on republican vanity. Every one was busied in preparing
to receive the prince, with his wife and courtiers,
for the Genevese desired that the pomps of this f&ecirc;te
should infinitely surpass those of the bishop’s reception.
There were (so to say) two men in these
citizens: one, full of lofty aspirations, longed for
truth and liberty; but the other, full of vanity and
fond of pleasure, allowed himself to be seduced by
luxury and the diversions of a court. The duke and
the bishop would never have succeeded in ruining
Geneva; but if Geneva united with them, her ruin
seemed inevitable. All heads were turned. ‘I shall
be dressed more expensively than you on the day of
the duchess’s entrance,’ said Jean de Malbuisson to
Jean Philippe, afterwards first syndic. Upon which,
Philippe, one of the proudest huguenots, ordered
a magnificent dress of satin, taffeta, velvet, and
silver, which cost him forty-eight crowns of the
sun. Malbuisson was filled with jealousy and anger,
and the syndics were compelled to interfere to appease
this strife of vanity.<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">312</a> These vain republicans,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
charmed at the honour to be done them by the
daughter of the king of Portugal, wished to strew her
path with roses. Portugal, governed by the famous
dynasty of Aviz, renowned by the expeditions of
Diaz, Vasco de Gama, and Cabral, and by the conquests
of Albuquerque, was then overflowing with
riches, was a naval power of the first order, and was
at the height of its greatness. It was no small thing
in the eyes of the burgesses of the city of the Leman
that the glory, which filled the most distant seas
with its splendour, should shed a few sparks of its
brilliancy on the shores of an unknown lake. The
duke had no doubt that these citizens, so fond of
pleasure, would quietly submit to the claims which
beauty laid upon them, and that Geneva would be his.</p>

<p>At last the 4th of August arrived, and all the city
hastened to the banks of the Arve to meet the young
and charming duchess; the women had the foremost
place in this Genevese procession. A battalion of
amazons, composed of three hundred of the youngest
and most beautiful persons in Geneva, appeared first.
They wore the colours of the duchess, blue and white;
their skirts, as was the fashion with the warlike
damsels of antiquity, were tucked up to the knee;
and each one carried in her right hand a javelin, and
in her left a small shield. At the head as captain was
the wife of the Seignior d’Avully, who, being a Spaniard,
could speak to the duchess in her own language:
in the middle was the standard-bearer, ‘a tall and
beautiful woman, waving the colours like a soldier
who had done nothing else all his life.’</p>

<p>The duchess appeared, seated in a triumphal chariot
drawn by four horses, and so covered with cloth of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
gold and jewels that all eyes were dazzled. The duke
rode by her side on a mule richly caparisoned, and a
multitude of noblemen followed them in magnificent
attire, smiling and talking to one another: the good-humoured
simplicity of these republicans charmed
them. They said that if they had failed with the
sword, they would succeed with jewellery, feathers, and
display; and that this rebellious city would be too
happy, in exchange for the amusements they would
give, to receive the duke and pay court to the pope.
Everything had been arranged to make the poison
enter their hearts by mild and subtle means. The
triumphal car having halted at Plainpalais, the queen
of the amazons approached the duchess and said:

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">En ce pays soyez la bienvenue!...<br /></span>
</span></span>

with other verses which we spare the reader. When
the princess arrived before the chapel of the Rhone,
where stood an image of the Virgin with the child
Jesus in her arms, a sibyl appeared and said:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For thee I have obtained a boon divine:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Son of God before thine eyes shall shine....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look up ... see him to Mary’s bosom pressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Virgin who hath borne him for our rest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With great devotion Mary’s son adore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he shall open wide to thee heaven’s door.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The procession passed successively under six triumphal
arches, dedicated to illustrious princesses,
before each of which Beatrice had to stop and hear a
new compliment. But it was labour lost: the haughty
Portuguese woman, far from thanking the ladies, did
not even look at them; and when the men came forward
in their turn in those magnificent dresses which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
had cost them so much money and contention, the
duchess received the <i>shopkeepers</i> with still greater contempt.
A deep feeling of discontent immediately
replaced the general enthusiasm: ‘She takes us for
her slaves, in Portugal fashion,’ exclaimed one of the
proudest of the huguenots. ‘Let us show her that
we are free men. Come, ladies, I advise you to
return to your spinning; and as for us, my friends,
we will pull down the galleries and destroy the
theatres.’ And then he whispered to one of his neighbours:
‘Better employ our money in fortifying the
city, and compelling these Savoyards to keep outside.
You entice them in ... take care they do not burn
you in your own straw.’ The duke’s counsellors
began to feel alarmed. The mine which they fancied
had been so skilfully dug, threatened to blow them
all into the air. Yet a few more mistakes of this kind
and all was lost.... Some of the courtiers endeavoured
to excuse the haughty manners of Beatrice by telling
the citizens: <i>Che eran los costumbres de Portugal.</i>
‘They were the fashions of Portugal.’ The duke
conjured his wife to make an effort to win back their
hearts.<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">313</a></p>

<p>Doubts were beginning at that time to be circulated
concerning the attachment of Geneva to the papacy.
Charles and his courtiers had heard something of
this; and the desire to keep the city in the fold of
Rome for ever had a great share, as we have remarked,
in their chivalrous enterprise. The mamelukes and
the canons, ashamed of these rumours, had prepared
a mystery-play calculated to make the duke and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
duchess believe that the Genevans thought much
more of seeking crosses and other relics than of finding
that New Testament so long unknown and about
which they were talking so much in Germany. Accordingly,
when the procession arrived at the Place
du Bourg de Four, they saw a large scaffold, a kind
of house, open on the side next the spectators, and
divided into several stories. The triumphal car halted,
and the people of Geneva who were afterwards to show
the world another spectacle, began to perform the
‘Invention of the Cross.’</p>

<p>The first scene represents Jerusalem, where the
Emperor Constantine and Helena, his mother, have
arrived to make search for the precious relic.

</div></div>

<p>Thus, therefore, the Genevese believed in the
miracles worked by the wood of the cross. How,
after such manifest proof, should not the world see
that Geneva was free from heresy?<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">314</a></p>

<p>The procession and the princess resumed their
march. They stopped before the h&ocirc;tel-de-ville, and
there the syndics made Beatrice a present from the city,
which she received <i>pleasantly</i> according to the lesson
the duke had given her. However, she could hold
up no longer: exhausted with fatigue, she begged to
be conducted to her lodging. They proceeded accordingly
towards the Dominican convent, where
apartments had been prepared for the duke and
duchess. This monastery, situated without the city,
on the banks of the Rhone, was one of the most
corrupt but also one of the richest in the diocese.
Here they arrived at last, Charles as delighted as
Beatrice was wearied. ‘The flies are caught by the
honey,’ said the duke; ‘yet a few more f&ecirc;tes, and
these proud Genevans will become our slaves.’</p>

<p>He lost no time, and, full of confidence in the
<i>prestige</i> of Portugal, the brilliancy of his court, and
the graces of his duchess, he began to give ‘great
banquets, balls, and f&ecirc;tes.’ Beatrice, having learnt
that it was necessary to win hearts in order to
win Geneva, showed herself agreeable to the ladies,
and entertained them with ‘exquisite viands,’ followed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
by ballets, masquerades, and plays. On his
part the duke organised tournaments with a great
concourse of noble cavaliers, assembled from all the
castles of the neighbouring provinces, and in which
the youth of Geneva contended with the lords of the
court. ‘We have never been so well amused since
the time of Duke Philibert,’ said the young Genevans.
To the allurements of pleasure Savoy added those of
gain. The court, which was ‘large and numerous,’
spent a great deal of money in the city, and thus
induced all those to love it who had given up their
minds to the desire for riches. Finally the attractions
of ambition were added to all the rest. To souls thirsting
for distinction Geneva could offer only a paltry
magistracy, whilst, by yielding themselves to Savoy,
they might aspire to the greatest honours; accordingly
the notables and even the syndics laid themselves at
the feet of the duke and duchess. ‘The prince was
better obeyed at Geneva than at Chamb&eacute;ry,’ says
Bonivard. Everything led the politicians to expect
complete success. That bold soaring towards independence
and the Gospel, so displeasing to the duke,
the king of France, and the emperor, was about
to be checked; and those alarming liberties, which
had slept for ages, but which now aspired after
emancipation, would be kept in restraint and subjection.<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">315</a></p>

<p>The calculations of the princes of Savoy were not,
however, so correct as they imagined. A circumstance
almost imperceptible might foil them. Whilst
the cabinet of Turin had plotted the ruin of Geneva,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
God was watching over its destinies. Shortly before
the entry of the bishop and the duke, another power
had arrived in Geneva; that power was the Gospel.
Towards the end of the preceding year, in October
and November 1522, Lef&egrave;vre published his French
translation of the New Testament. At the same
time the friends of the Word of God, being persecuted
at Paris, had taken refuge in different provinces. A
merchant named Vaugris, and a gentleman named
Du Blet, were at Lyons, despatching thence missionaries
and New Testaments into Burgundy and
Dauphiny, to Grenoble and Vienne.<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">316</a> In the sixteenth
century as in the second, the Gospel ascended
the Rhone. From Lyons and Vienne came in 1523
to the shores of Lake Leman that Word of God which
had once destroyed the superstitions of paganism,
and which was now to destroy the excrescences of
Rome. ‘Some people called evangelicals came from
France,’ says a <i>Memoir to the Pope on the Rebellion of
Geneva</i> in the archives of Turin. The names of the
pious men who first brought the Holy Scriptures to
the people of Geneva, have been no better preserved
than the names of the missionaries of the second
century: it is generally in the darkness of night that
beacon fires are kindled. Some Genevans ‘talked with
them and bought their books,’ adds the MS. Thus,
while the canons were assisting in the representation of
time-worn fables, and holding up as an example the
piety of those who had sought for the cross in the
bowels of the earth, more elevated souls in Geneva
were seeking for the cross in the Scriptures. One
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
of the first to welcome these biblical colporteurs was
Baudichon de la Maison-Neuve, a man bold and
ardent even to imprudence, but true, upright, and
generous. He was enraptured to find in the Gospel
the strength he needed to attack the superstitions of
old times, which filled him with instinctive disgust.
Robert Vandel did the same. Syndic in 1529, and
employed in all the important affairs of the time, he
found in these works which had come from Lyons a
means of realising his ideal, which was to make Geneva
a republic independent in religion as well as in politics.
These noble-hearted men and many besides them
read the Scriptures with astonishment. They sought,
but they could find no Roman religion there&mdash;no
images, no mass, no pope; but they found an authority
and power above prelates and councils and pontiffs,
and even princes themselves&mdash;a new authority, new
doctrine, new life, new church ... and all these new
things were the old things which the apostles had
founded. It was as if the quickening breath of spring
had begun to be felt in the valley after the rigours of
a long winter. They went out into the open air;
they basked in the rays of the sun; they exercised
their benumbed limbs. Priests and bigot laymen
looked with astonishment at this new spectacle.
What! they had hoped that the pompous entrance
of Charles and Beatrice would secure their triumph,
and now an unknown book, entering mysteriously
into the city, without pomp, without display, without
cloth of gold, borne humbly on the back of some
poor pedlar, seemed destined to produce a greater
effect than the presence of the brother-in-law of
Charles V. and of the daughter of the kings of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
Portugal.... Was the victory to slip from their hands
in the very hour of success? Was Geneva destined
to be anything more than a little city in Savoy and
a parish of the pope’s?... Disturbed at this movement
of men’s minds, some of the papal agents hastened
to write to Rome: ‘What a singular thing!
a new hope has come to these dejected rebels.... And
to those books which have been brought from France
and which they buy of the evangelicals, the Genevans
look for their enfranchisement.’<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">317</a></p>

<p>In fact, the triumph of the duke, the duchess, and
their court, who had succeeded in leading certain
Genevans into dissipation and servility, exasperated
the huguenots: they never met without giving vent,
as they grasped each other’s hands, to some expression
of scorn or sorrow. Among them was Jean Philippe,
several times elected captain-general. He was not
one of those whom the Holy Scriptures had converted:
he was a rich and generous citizen, full of courage
and a great friend of liberty; but loving better to
pull down than to build up, and carrying boldness
even to rashness. He proposed that they should give
a lesson to the mamelukes and priests, ‘and undertook
to bear all the expenses.’ Other huguenots,
more moderate, and above all more pious, held it of
importance to make known the impressions they had
received from the Gospel. The Word of God having
touched their hearts, they desired to show that it was
a remedy for all the ills of humanity. Seeing that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
everybody was eager to entertain the duke and
duchess, they resolved to add their dish also to the
banquet, seasoning it however with a few grains of
salt. Instead of the discovery of the cross by Helena,
they will celebrate the discovery of the Bible by the
Reformation. The subject was not ill-chosen, as it
brought out strongly the contrast between the old
and the new times. The huguenots therefore informed
the duke that they were desirous of performing
a mystery-play in his honour in the open air
on the Sunday after a certain holiday called Les
Bordes. Jean Philippe having generously provided
for all the expenses, the young men learnt their parts,
and everything was ready for the representation.</p>

<p>It was fair-time at Geneva, and consequently a
great crowd of Genevans and strangers soon gathered
round the theatre: the Bishop of Maurienne arrived;
lords and ladies of high descent took their seats; but
they waited in vain for the duke, who did not appear.
‘We shall not go, neither the duchess nor myself,’
he said, ‘because the performers are huguenots.’
Charles, knowing his men well, feared some snake in
the grass. The huguenot who had composed the
piece represented the state of the world under the
image of a <i>disease</i>, and the Reformation as the <i>remedy</i>
by which God desired to cure it; the subject and
title of his drama was <i>Le Monde Malade</i>, the Sick
World, and everything was to appear&mdash;priests,
masses, the Bible and its followers. The principal
character, <i>Le Monde</i> (the World), had heard certain
monks, terrified at the books which had lately come
from France, announce that the last days were at
hand, and that the World would soon perish. It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
was to be burnt by fire and drowned by water....
This was too much for him; he trembled, his health
declined, and he pined away. The people about him
grew uneasy, and one of them exclaimed:

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The World grows weaker every day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What he will come to, who can say?<br /></span>
</span></span>

He had however some friends, and each of them
brought him a new remedy; but all was useless&mdash;the
World grew worse and worse. He decided then to
resort to the sovereign universal remedy, by which
even the dead are saved, namely, masses. The
Romish worship, assailed by the reformers, was now
on its trial in the streets of Geneva.</p>

<p>Then <i>Le Conseiller</i> (the Counsellor), a wise and
enlightened man, recommends a new remedy, one
both harmless and effectual, which is beginning to
make a great noise.

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What is it, say?<br /></span>
</span></span>

asks the World; the Counsellor answers:

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A thing which no man dares gainsay ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">The Bible</span>.<br /></span>
</span></span>

The World does not know what this new medicine
means: another character strives in vain to inspire
him with confidence:

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Believe me, Mr. World, there’s not a fool<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But knows it.<br /></span>
</span></span>

The World will not have it at any price. It was known
already at Geneva in 1523 that the world was giving
a bad reception to the Gospel: ‘They shall say all
manner of evil against you, and shall persecute you.’
As he could not be cured by the priests, and would
not be cured by the Bible, the World called in the
Doctor (<i>le M&eacute;decin</i>), and carefully described his
disease:

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I am so troubled, and teased, and tormented,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all the rubbish that they have invented ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That flat here on my bed I lie.<br /></span>
</span><span class="stanza">
<span class="center"><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Will come, and that a <i>fire</i> to boot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will burn us all both branch and root.<br /></span>
</span></span>

But the Doctor happens to be (as was often the case
in the sixteenth century) one of those who believe the
text of the Bible to be infallible; he begins to paint
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
the liveliest picture of the disorders of the clergy, in
order to induce his patient to take the remedy prescribed
for him:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Why are you troubled, Sir World, at that?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do not vex yourself any more<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of war, to the shame of the christian name.<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">318</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The World, astonished at a description so far from
catholic, becomes suspicious, thinks the language
heretical, and exclaims:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">... Mere fables these:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the land of <span class="smcap">Luther</span> they came.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Upon Luther’s back men lay the blame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you speak of sin....<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At Geneva, therefore, as well as in all the catholic
world, Luther was already known as the man who
laid bare sins. The Doctor did not allow himself to
be disconcerted by this charge of Lutheranism:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">World, would you like to be well once more?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="center"><span class="smcap">The World</span>, <i>with firmness</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i5">Then think of abuses what a store<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are daily committed by great and small,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And <i>according to law</i> reform them all.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
</div></div>

<p>This was demanding a Reformation. The huguenots
(<i>Eidguenots</i>) applauded; the foreign merchants
were astonished; the courtiers of Savoy, and
even Maurienne himself, smiled. Still Maison-Neuve,
Vandel, Bernard, and all those who had ‘talked with’
the evangelicals, and especially the author of the
drama, knew the difficulties the Reformation would
have to encounter in Geneva.</p>

<p>The World, irritated against these laymen who turn
preachers, exclaims:

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This impudent doctor so mild of speech,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I asked him to cure me, not to <i>preach</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fool!<br /></span>
</span></span>

Another personage, alarmed at so unprecedented
a thing:

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i10">Good heavens! it can’t be true.<br /></span>
</span><span class="stanza">
<span class="center"><span class="smcap">The World.</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">True enough; but as for his preaching now,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Than a preacher.<br /></span>
</span><span class="stanza">

</span><span class="stanza">
<span class="center"><span class="smcap">The World.</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That will I!...<br /></span>
</span></span>

Whereupon the World puts on a fool’s dress, and the
burlesque ends.</p>

<p>It is too true that the world, after the Reformation,
put on a fool’s dress in various places, particularly in
France. What was the house of Valois but a house
of fools? And yet a divine wisdom had then entered
the world, and remains in it still, for the healing of
nations. From the beginning of 1523, the great principle
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
of protestantism which declares Scripture to be
the only source and rule of truth, in opposition to that
of Roman Catholicism, which substitutes the authority
of the Church, was recognised in Geneva. The ‘text
of the Bible’ was publicly declared ‘an irreproachable
thing’ and the only remedy for the cure of diseased
humanity. And what, at bottom, was this burlesque
of the huguenots but a lay sermon on the text: <i>The
law of the Lord converteth the soul</i>? It is good to
observe the date, as it is generally thought that the
Reformation did not begin till much later in the
city of Calvin. This ‘mystery’ of a new kind did not
remain without effect; the evangelicals had taken up
their position; the ram, armed with its head of brass,
that was to batter and throw down the walls of Rome&mdash;the
infallible Bible, had appeared. Jean Philippe
felt that the piece had not cost him too dear.</p>

<p>The stage of the <i>Monde Malade</i> had scarcely been
pulled down, when the citizens had to think of something
else besides plays. The Savoyards, who did not
like the dish served up to them, and thought they smelt
the poison of heresy in it, resolved to avenge themselves
by making the weight of their yoke felt. Two words
comprehend the whole policy of these soldiers and
courtiers: despotism of the prince, servility of the
people. They undertook to mould the Genevans to
their system. With haughty mien and arrogant tone
they were continually picking quarrels with the citizens;
they called everything too dear that was sold
them, they got into a passion and struck the shopkeepers,
and the latter, who had no arms, were obliged
at first to put up with these insults. But erelong
every one armed himself, and the tradesmen, raising
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
their heads, crossed swords with these insolent lords.
There was a great uproar in the city. Irritated at
this resistance, the grand-master of the court hastened
to the council: ‘The duke and duchess came here,’
he said, ‘thinking to be with friends.’ The council
ordered the citizens to be arrested who had struck
the gentlemen, and the Savoyard quarter-master undertook
to lock them up, which the Genevan quarter-master
resisted. The duke, in a passion, threatened
to bring in his subjects ‘to pillage the place.’ There
was some reason, it must be confessed, to desire a little
tranquillity. ‘The duchess is willing to do us the
honour of being brought to bed in this city,’ said
Syndic Baud to the people; ‘please do not make any
disturbance; and as soon as you hear the bells and
trumpets, go in procession with tapers and torches,
and pray to God for her.’</p>

<p>The ‘honour’ which the duchess was about to
confer on Geneva did not affect the Genevans. The
most courageous citizens, Aim&eacute; L&eacute;vrier, John Lullin,
and others, were superior to all such seductions.
Faithful interpreter of the law, calm but intrepid
guardian of the customs and constitutions, L&eacute;vrier
continually reminded the council that Charles was not
sovereign in Geneva. While avoiding a noisy opposition,
he displayed unshrinking firmness; and accordingly
the duke began to think that he could only
become prince of the city by passing over his body.
Lullin was not a jurist like L&eacute;vrier, but active, practical,
and energetic; at every opportunity he manifested
his love of liberty, and sometimes did so with rudeness.
Although prior of the confraternity of St. Loup, he
was at the same time landlord of the <i>Bear</i> inn, which,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
according to the manners of those days, was not
incompatible with a high position in the city. One day
when his stables were full of horses belonging to a poor
Swiss carrier, some richly-dressed gentlemen of Savoy
alighted noisily before the inn and prepared to put up
their horses. ‘There is no room, gentlemen!’ said
Lullin roughly. ‘They are the duke’s horses,’ replied
the courtiers. ‘No matter,’ returned the energetic
huguenot. ‘First come, first served. I would rather
lodge carriers than princes.’ At that time Charles
was raising six thousand men, to be present in Geneva
at his child’s christening, and the cavaliers probably
belonged to this body. But the huguenots thought
it too much to have six thousand godfathers armed
from head to foot, and it was probably this that put
Lullin in bad humour. Charles was weak but violent;
he stamped his foot when told of the insult
offered to his servants, cast a furious glance over the
city, and exclaimed with an oath: ‘I will make this
city of Geneva smaller than the smallest village in
Savoy.’<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">319</a> Many trembled when they heard of the
threat, and the council, to pacify the prince, sent
Lullin to prison for three days.</p>

<p>At length the great event arrived on which the
hopes of Savoy reposed. On the 2nd December one
of the duke’s officers informed the syndics that the
duchess had been delivered at noon of a prince. Immediately
the bells were rung, the trumpets sounded:
bishop, canons, priests, monks, confraternities, boys
and girls dressed in white and carrying tapers in their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
hands, all walked in long procession. Bonfires were
lighted in every open place, and the cannons on the
esplanade (La Treille) which looks towards Savoy
announced to that faithful country that the duke had
a son.<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">320</a> ‘As he was born in Geneva,’ said the courtiers
to one another, ‘the citizens cannot refuse him
for their prince.’<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">321</a> The duchess had the matter very
much at heart, and erelong, richly apparelled and
seated in her bed, as was the custom, she would say in
the frivolous conversations she had with the persons
admitted to pay their court to her: ‘This city is a
<i>buena posada</i>’ (a very good inn). The delighted duke
replied: ‘Geneva shall be yours,’ which she was very
pleased to hear.<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">322</a></p>

<p>Everything in Geneva and even in Europe seemed
to favour the designs of Savoy. Charles V. the duke’s
brother-in-law, and Francis I. his nephew, were
preparing for the war in Lombardy. The struggle
between the pope and Luther occupied men’s minds.
The Swiss were ‘in great care and discord, city
divided against city, and one against another in the
same city.’ Bishop Pierre de la Baume was fickle,
worldly, fond of gambling, of feasting, of waiting
upon the ladies, and of pursuing other pleasures
which diverted him from better occupations. Timid
and even fearful, changing like a weathercock with
every wind, he dreaded above all things to lose the
benefices he possessed in the territory of his Highness.
All this permitted Charles&mdash;at least he thought so&mdash;quietly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
to invade Geneva and unite it to Savoy without
Europe’s saying a word. To have his hands still
freer, he persuaded De la Baume that his presence in
Italy was necessary for the emperor’s service.<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">323</a> That
done, and thinking the fruit ripe and ready to fall, the
duke and duchess made preparations for striking the
final blow. They clearly saw the hostile disposition of
many of the Genevans; but that was only an additional
reason for increased exertions. If, now that a prince
of Savoy was born in Geneva, the duke failed in his
projects, everything would be lost for many a day.
The cue was therefore given to all the Savoyard
nobility. The beauty of their gold pieces dazzled
the shopkeepers; sports, dinners, balls, masquerades,
plays, tournaments, pomp, finery, pleasures, luxuries,
and all the allurements which seduce men (say
contemporary writers), captivated the worldly and
particularly the youth. Some few huguenots talked
loudly of independence; some old Genevans still
strove to retain their sons; some venerable mothers,
seeing their children setting out for the court dressed
in their gayest clothes, asked them if they did not
blush for the old manners of their fathers,&mdash;if they
desired to sell their free souls and become the servants
of princes?... But all was useless. ‘It is like throwing
water on a ball,’ said the afflicted parents; ‘not a
drop stays there.’&mdash;‘What would you have?’ replied
these giddy youths. ‘It is stronger than us. As
soon as the charms of the world appear, our appetites
carry us away, like runaway horses.’</p>

<p>The monks did not remain behind in this work of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
corruption. On the 20th of May the Dominicans celebrated
the Feast of St. Ives, and invited the youth to
one of those notorious vigils where all sorts of abominations
were practised. The syndics complained ineffectually
to the vicar-general of the scandalous lives
(<i>scelerat&aelig; vit&aelig;</i>) of these friars. ‘Go to the convent and
remonstrate with them,’ said this ecclesiastic. And
when the syndics went there, the prior acknowledged
that the monks led a dissolute life, but, he added, ‘it
is to no purpose that I speak to them of correction;
they answer that, if I do not hold my tongue, they
will turn me out of the monastery.’<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">324</a> By their vices
the clergy were digging a gulf beneath their feet, into
which they would drag everything&mdash;doctrine, worship,
and Church. All appeared to combine for the enslavement
of Geneva. Neither the emperor, nor the king,
nor the pope, nor the bishop, nor the Swiss, nor even
the Genevese themselves, watched over the independence
of the city. The living waters of the Gospel
alone could purify these Augean stables. ‘God only
remained,’ said Bonivard; ‘but while Geneva slept,
He kept watch for her.’<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">325</a></p>

<p>Geneva was indeed about to wake up. The enervating
dreams of the ‘golden youth’ were beginning
to fade away. Not only those to whom the New Testament
had been brought, not only the friends of independence,
but thoughtful men of order and of law
were going to oppose the duke. A new martyr was
to fertilise a generous soil with his blood, and prepare
the final victory of right and liberty.

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">There</span> was one citizen in Geneva who greatly
embarrassed the duke, and this was L&eacute;vrier. It
was neither from pride, resentment, nor envy that he
resisted the usurpations of the prince, but from an
ardent love of justice and respect for the old charters
of liberty. He had less spirit than Berthelier, but
more gravity; less popularity, but severer manners;
more prudence, and quite as much courage. He was
not a declaimer; he did not, like the energetic Philibert
or the impetuous Maison-Neuve, make his voice
heard in the streets: it was in the councils where he
calmly put forward his inflexible <i>veto</i>. The more
violent huguenots reproached him with his moderation;
they said that ‘when men are too stiff to yield
to the breath of persuasion, we must strike them
heavily with the hammer; and when flaming brands
are kindling a conflagration everywhere, we must rush
upon them like a torrent and extinguish them.’ But
L&eacute;vrier, firm in regard to right, was mild in regard
to men. An intrepid preserver of the law, he upheld
it without clamour, but without hesitation or fear.
Never has there lived, in ancient or in modern republics,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
a citizen of whom it could be better said than
of him:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>The moment approached when L&eacute;vrier would say
in Geneva for liberty what Luther had lately said in
Worms for truth: ‘I can do no otherwise.’ But, less
fortunate than the monk of Wittemberg, he will hardly
have uttered these words before he will receive his
death-blow. These martyrs of liberty at the foot of
the Alps, who were to be followed in so many different
places by the martyrs of the Gospel, lit up a new flame
upon the earth. And hence it is that a grateful posterity,
represented by the pious christians of the New
World, places a triumphal garland on the humble
tombs of Berthelier and of L&eacute;vrier, as well as of Luther
and of Calvin.<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">327</a></p>

<p>As the office of vidame belonged to the duke, it was
always through the vidamy that the princes of Savoy
interfered with the affairs of Geneva; and accordingly
they nominated to this post only such men as were
well known for the servility of their character. The
duke had replaced the wretched Aymon Conseil by
the Sieur de Salagine; and when the latter died, he
nominated Verneau, sire of Rougemont and one of
his chamberlains, in his place.<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">328</a> ‘Oh, oh!’ said the
citizens, ‘the duke knows his men. If Conseil knew
so well the sound of his tabor, this man knows it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
better still, and we shall have a pretty dance.’<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">329</a>
Charles, dissatisfied with the inferior jurisdiction that
belonged to him, proposed to make the conquest of
Geneva, and to accomplish it in two movements. By
the first, he would take possession of all the courts
of law; by the second, of the sovereignty. And
then his sojourn in Geneva would have attained its
end.</p>

<p>By way of beginning, Charles desired that the vidame
should make oath to him and not to the bishop&mdash;a
pretension opposed to the constitution, for in Geneva
the prince of Savoy was only an inferior officer
of the bishop; and the duke in this way substituted
himself for the prince of the city. They were nearly
giving way, for the Marquis of St. Sorlin, the prelate’s
brother, intrusted with the bishop’s temporal
interests while he was in Italy, and even the episcopal
council, desired to please the duke and grant something
to so mighty a lord. But that vigilant sentinel L&eacute;vrier
immediately placed himself in the breach. He represented
to the episcopal council that the bishop was
not free to sacrifice the rights of the state; that he
was only the simple administrator, and had to render
an account ‘to the empire, the chapter, the republic,
and posterity.’ The vidame was forced to make oath
to the bishop’s representatives, whereupon the irritated
duke ordered his chamberlain to give an account of his
office to none but him. L&eacute;vrier saw that Savoy was
planting her batteries against Geneva&mdash;that the war
was beginning; and determining to save the independence
of his country, he resolved to oppose, even at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
the risk of his life, the criminal usurpations of the
foreign prince.<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">330</a></p>

<p>The struggle between the duke and the judge
threatened to become terrible, and could only be
ended by the death of one of the combatants or the
expulsion of the other. Everything was favourable
to the duke. ‘Who can hinder him,’ said his courtiers,
‘from becoming sovereign of Geneva?&mdash;The
bishop? Although he may make a great fuss, he
will easily be quieted, for he has benefices without
number in his Highness’s states.&mdash;Pope Clement?
The duke is in alliance with him.&mdash;The emperor?
His marriage with the duchess’s sister is in progress.&mdash;The
Swiss League? They are in great anxiety
about the house of Austria, and they too are divided
city against city on account of religion.&mdash;The people
of Geneva? The court, by spending its money freely,
has gained them.&mdash;Berthelier? He is dead.&mdash;The
other huguenots? They were so roughly handled at
the time of the former enterprise, that they are afraid
of getting into hot water again.... What remains to
prevent the duke from accomplishing his undertaking?’&mdash;‘There
remains but God,’ said the patriots.<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">331</a></p>

<p>It was Charles’s disposition to seek to triumph by
stratagem rather than by force. In that age princes
imagined that no one could resist them; he therefore
attempted to win over L&eacute;vrier by means of those favours
of which courtiers are so greedy. But in order
to succeed, it was necessary to have a little private
talk with him away from Geneva and the Genevans.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
‘What glorious sunshine!’ said they one morning at
the ducal court: ‘let us take advantage of this fine
winter weather to visit the castle of Bonne and
spend a few days at the foot of the soft and smiling
slopes of the Voirons mountain.’ The duke, the
duchess, and the court made their preparations, and,
as a special mark of his good-will, Charles invited
L&eacute;vrier to accompany him. Arrived at this charming
retreat, surrounded by snow-clad mountains
gilded by the bright sunshine, the duke led the
worthy man aside, addressed him in friendly language,
and as L&eacute;vrier answered with respect, Charles
profited by what he thought to be a favourable
moment, and said to him in an insinuating tone:
‘You know that I am sovereign lord of Geneva, and
that you are my subject.’&mdash;‘No, my lord,’ immediately
replied the judge, ‘I am not your subject, and you
are not sovereign of Geneva.’ The duke dissembled
his anger, but L&eacute;vrier seeming impatient to return to
Geneva, Charles allowed him to depart, and as he saw
that inflexible man disappear, he swore that he should
pay dearly for his boldness ... at the foot of that
very mountain, in that very castle where he had
dared tell the Duke of Savoy that he was not his
sovereign.<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">332</a></p>

<p>The duke returned, and being resolved to put his
hand to the task, he communicated to the episcopal
council, with all suitable precautions, his firm intention
to assume henceforward the rights of sovereignty.
Charles knew the weakness, the venality even of the
prince-bishop’s councillors, who were unwilling at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
any price to displease Savoy. As soon as the report
of this demand was known in the city, everybody exclaimed
against it; they said that the superior jurisdiction
belonged only to the sovereign, and that if the
duke should obtain it, he would have to take but one
step more to be recognised as lord of Geneva. The
weakest thought their independence lost. ‘Be easy,’
said wiser men, ‘there is a certain “child of Geneva”
in the council, who will shut all their mouths.’ They
were not deceived; determined to oppose an inflexible
resistance to Charles’s demand, L&eacute;vrier began to
strengthen the weak, to win over the cowards, and to
intimidate the traitors. ‘Neither the duke nor the
senate of Savoy,’ he said, ‘has any authority in Geneva.
The jurisdiction belongs to the city and to its
head, the bishop: the duke, when within our walls,
is a vassal, and not a sovereign.’<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">333</a> These bold but
true words made a deep impression; Gruet, the vicar-episcopal,
resolved to join L&eacute;vrier in defending the
rights of his master. The opposition was not less
energetic among the citizens. It was the time for
nominating syndics; the alarmed huguenots resolved
to place one of the warmest friends of independence
among the chief magistrates. They elected Claude
Richardet, a man of steady principles and decided
character, ‘tall, handsome, powerful, and very choleric,’
says a chronicle.</p>

<p>When Charles and his counsellors saw the episcopal
and the popular authorities uniting against
them, they did not lose heart, but preached openly in
Geneva the system which the dukes of Savoy had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
long adopted&mdash;the necessity of separating Church
and State. What did it matter if L&eacute;vrier, and even
Gruet, the vicar-episcopal, made a show of defending
the bishop’s temporal rights?&mdash;the duke believed that
Pierre de la Baume would be found tractable. The
most advanced huguenots desired to have a free
church in a free state; but the duke wanted a church
enslaved by the pope in a state enslaved by the duke.
‘Let the bishop keep his clerical authority,’ said the
ducal officers, who were irritated by the opposition of
the episcopal officers; ‘let him keep his amulets,
chaplets, and all such wares; let his parishioners indulge,
some in sensuality, others in mortifications; let
them, with all the monks, black, white, and grey, debauchees,
gamblers, inquisitors, mountebanks, flagellants,
women of lewd life, and indulgence-sellers, go
on a pilgrimage to Loretto, to St. James of Compostella,
to Mecca if the bishop likes ... well and good
... that is the priests’ department, and we abandon
it to them. But the civil power belongs to the laity;
the courts of secular justice, the municipal liberties,
and the command of the troops ought to be in the
hands of a secular prince. Souls to the bishop, body
and goods to my lord of Savoy!’ This great zeal for
the separation of the religious from the political order
had no other object than to satisfy the ambition of
Savoy. But Geneva profited by these interested homilies,
and emancipated herself even beyond Charles’s
wishes. Yet a few more years, and this city will
be enfranchised from both kinds of despotism. The
temporal and spiritual power will be taken from the
hands of the bishop nominated by Rome; and while
the former will be restored to the hands of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
citizens, the latter will be in the hands of the Head
of the Church and of his Word of truth.</p>

<p>The day after the election, the duke held a grand
reception. The new syndics came to pay their respects
to him; Gruet, the vicar, and other episcopal
officers were present. Charles on a sudden unmasked
his battery: ‘Mr. Vicar, I have heard that the episcopal
officers of this city interfere in profane matters;
I mean to reform this abuse; the State and the
Church are two distinct spheres. Hitherto my officers,
the vidames, have not had sufficient power.<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">334</a> Having
recently nominated one of my chamberlains to this
post, a man much esteemed and of good repute, the
noble Hugh de Rougemont, I shall no longer permit
the bishop to interfere in civil causes.’ The vicar,
who had been prepared by L&eacute;vrier for this attack
and remembered the lesson well, made answer: ‘Your
Highness is aware that my lord of Geneva is both
bishop and prince; he possesses the two jurisdictions
in this city.’ The irascible duke, who did
not expect any opposition from a vicar, grew angry:
‘I intend that it shall be so no longer,’ he continued;
‘and if the bishop pardons when my vidame
has condemned, I will hang up with their letters
of grace all to whom he grants them.’ Everybody
trembled. The pusillanimous vicar held his
tongue, while the syndics endeavoured to pacify the
prince, although at the same time backing up Gruet’s
remarks. Then the courtiers of Savoy came forward,
and, playing the part that had been assigned them in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
this wretched comedy, magnified the favours which
the duke would heap on the city. There would be
signal advantages for commerce, merchandise at half
price, great rejoicings, magnificent feasts, f&ecirc;te after
f&ecirc;te for the ladies of the city,<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">335</a> graceful and friendly
combats in presence of their highnesses, dances and
tournaments.<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">336</a> Geneva would become a little paradise.
The duke was such a good prince, what folly to
reject him! Notwithstanding all this coaxing, the
huguenots thought to themselves that the prince’s
mule, be he ever so richly harnessed, none the less
carries a saddle that galls him.</p>

<p>The duke took counsel again. He thought he had
made an important step at the time of the syndics’
reception. He had now resided eight months in
Geneva, as if he had no other capital; now or never
he must realise the hereditary schemes of his family.
He must hurry on the conclusion, and with that view
get rid of the obstacle. That obstacle was L&eacute;vrier.
This Mordecai, who refused to bow before him,
thwarted the projects of Turin and exasperated the
weak Charles and the haughty Beatrice. All the
courtiers rose against him: they hesitated no longer.
Sometimes bold strokes are necessary, and Machiavelli
had taught the princes of Italy what was to be done
in such cases. They thought that the annexation of
Geneva to Savoy was of too great importance not to
require the sacrifice of a victim. This man was as a
rock in their path, obstructing their advance: it was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
necessary to remove it. L&eacute;vrier’s death was decided
upon.</p>

<p>The bishop’s council, which was regarded by the
episcopalians as the sovereign council, was summoned
to appear before the duke; all the members, except
L&eacute;vrier, attended. The episcopal councillors had
hardly entered Charles’s presence, ‘when, unable to
contain himself, he waxed very wroth.’ ‘Do you
presume,’ he exclaimed, ‘to disobey my orders?’
Then by his gestures, indicating his cruel intentions,
he addressed them in such savage language ‘as to
put them in fear of their lives.’ The councillors, who
were almost frightened to death, ‘then did like the
stag, which (says a chronicle) casts his horns to the
dogs in order to save himself.’<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">337</a> ‘My lord,’ they
said, ‘it is not our fault; it is L&eacute;vrier that has done
it all; he maintains stoutly that Monsieur of Savoy
has no authority in Geneva.’ Whereupon the duke,
pretending not to know him, exclaimed: ‘What!
another L&eacute;vrier in my path! Why his father opposed
the surrender of the artillery of Geneva to me in
1507! Bring the son here!’ The judge’s colleagues
consented, provided the duke would engage on his
side to do him no injury, which Charles promised.</p>

<p>L&eacute;vrier knew that his life was at stake, and everybody
advised him to leave Geneva; but he resolved
not to go out of his way. Two days after the
first conference, the episcopal council, accompanied
by L&eacute;vrier, appeared again before the duke, who
had scarcely caught sight of him, when, fiercely
scowling at them, he said: ‘There are some of you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
who say that I am not sovereign of Geneva.’ ... He
stopped short, but finding that they all remained
silent, he continued: ‘It is one L&eacute;vrier.’ ... Then
fixing his angry eyes upon him, he called out with
a threatening voice: ‘Is that fellow L&eacute;vrier here?’
Consternation fell upon all the spectators: ‘they
huddled together, but said not a word.’ Charles,
who knew L&eacute;vrier very well, observing that terror
had so far answered, repeated in a still louder tone:
‘Is that fellow L&eacute;vrier here?’&mdash;The judge modestly
stepped forward and said calmly: ‘Here I am, my
lord.’ The duke, whom such calmness irritated still
more, burst out: ‘Have you not said that I am not
sovereign of Geneva?’&mdash;‘My lord,’ he answered, ‘if
I have said anything, it was in the council, where
every one has the right to speak freely. You ought
not to know of it, and I ought not to be molested about
it.’&mdash;‘Go,’ said the duke, not heeding this just remark,
‘prepare to prove to me within three days that
what you say is true. Otherwise I will not answer
for your life ... wherever I may be. Leave my
presence!’<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">338</a> And they all went out.</p>

<p>‘L&eacute;vrier departed in great trouble,’ said Bonivard.
The death with which he was threatened was inevitable.
There were plenty of authentic acts, the
<i>Franchises</i> in particular, by which he could prove
that the duke possessed no authority in Geneva; but
many of these documents were in the hands of the
canons, devoted to the duke; and the syndics refused
to lay before the prince such as were in their care,
for fear he should throw them into the fire. It is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
not improbable that such was Charles’s intention
when he called for them.<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">339</a> ‘He has set a condition
upon my life,’ said L&eacute;vrier, ‘which it is impossible to
fulfil.... Do what I may, there is nothing left for me
but to die.’</p>

<p>His friends wished to save him at all hazards.
Bonivard, who was less courageous than L&eacute;vrier, and
under similar circumstances had taken to flight, continually
reverted to the subject: ‘There is no escape,’
he said, ‘except you leave the country.’ But L&eacute;vrier
was not to be moved. Faithful preserver of the
ancient customs, he was determined to oppose the
usurpations of Savoy to the very last. According to
the Genevese, St. Peter&mdash;they did not mean the
pope&mdash;was the prince of their city. Had they not
the key of this apostle in their escutcheon? L&eacute;vrier
replied to the entreaties of his friends, and especially
of Bonivard: ‘I would rather die for the liberty of the
city and for the authority of St. Peter, than confess
myself guilty by deserting my post.’ The prior of
St. Victor was greatly distressed at the answer. He
insisted, he conjured his friend, but all to no purpose.
‘Is it imprudence on his part?’ said he then. ‘Is it
envy that urges him to be the rival of Berthelier? Is it
that he desires to be a champion of the commonwealth
at the price of his blood? I know not what motive
impels him; but be it what it may, he will no longer
confide in our advice.’ L&eacute;vrier, indeed, went about
just as before, even after the term (three days) prescribed
by the duke; he waited tranquilly for the blow
to fall upon him.<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">340</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span></p>

<p>Charles the Good&mdash;such is the name he bears in
the history of Savoy&mdash;was plotting the death of this
just man. His steward and favourite, the Sieur de
Bellegarde, was an enemy of L&eacute;vrier’s, and all the
more violent because he had long been his friend. The
prince and his steward deliberated over the means
best calculated to make away with him. At Geneva
it seemed impossible; and as a second edition of
Berthelier’s death was out of the question, it became
necessary to draw L&eacute;vrier into some lonely spot, where
he might easily be put to death. Bellegarde undertook
to carry him off, and the duke ordered him to be
brought to the castle of Bonne, where L&eacute;vrier had
dared to say him <i>No!</i> Bellegarde came to an understanding
with some Savoyard gentlemen, and being
informed that on Saturday, the 12th of March, the
judge would attend mass as usual in the cathedral of
St. Pierre, the steward arranged with these infamous
courtiers that they should lie in ambush near the
church, and seize him as he came out.</p>

<p>Everything was prepared for the ambuscade. The
person who should have prevented it, and the person
who commanded it, both left the city. The cowardly
Marquis of St. Sorlin, who, as representative of the
bishop, ought to have defended L&eacute;vrier, having ‘smelt
the wind,’ went out to Rumilly, where he amused himself
with some ladies while men were preparing to kill
the defender of his brother’s rights. Charles did pretty
nearly the same. The appointed day having arrived
(it was the eve of the Sunday before Easter 1524),
this prince, poor in courage, trembling at the idea of
the daring deed about to be attempted, fearing lest
the people should rise and come to his residence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
and demand the just man about to be torn from them,
stealthily quitted his apartments in the lower part of
the city near the Rhone, ‘went out by a back door,’
crossed the lonely meadows which the Arve bathes
with its swift waters, and ‘retired with his family to
Our Lady of Grace, pretending that he was going
there to hear mass.’ This church being near the bridge
of Arve, the duke, in case a riot should break out,
would only have to cross the bridge to be in his
own territory. Having thus provided for his own
safety, he waited in great agitation for the news of
his victim.</p>

<p>Mass was over in the cathedral, the priest had
elevated the host, the chants had ceased, and L&eacute;vrier
quitted the church. He wore a long camlet robe,
probably his judicial gown, and a beautiful velvet
cassock. He had hardly set foot outside the cemetery
(the site is now occupied by the hall of the
Consistory) when Bellegarde and his friends, surrounding
him with drawn swords, ‘laid their hands
roughly upon him; and Bressieu, the most violent of
them, struck him so severely on the head with the
pommel of his sword,’ that he was stunned. There
was not a moment to lose, lest the people should rise.
Some of the gentlemen armed cap-&agrave;-pie went in front,
others came behind, and they dragged the prisoner
rapidly to Plainpalais, where all had been got ready
to complete the abduction. L&eacute;vrier was put upon a
wretched horse, his hands were tied behind his back,
his legs were fastened below the belly of his steed;
and the escort set off full gallop for the castle of
Bonne, where he had formerly dared to deny that the
duke was sovereign of Geneva.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span></p>

<p>On they went, the horsemen loading L&eacute;vrier with
abuse: ‘Huguenot, rebel, traitor!’ But in the midst
of these insults the judge, pinioned like a murderer,
remained calm and firm, and endured their indignities
without uttering a word. He was grieved at the injustice
of his enemies, but as he thought of the cause
for which he suffered, joy prevailed over sorrow. He
had been accustomed all his life to struggle with
affliction, and now that ‘the cross was laid on his
shoulders,’ it was easier for him to bear it. ‘To give
his life for right and liberty,’ said a contemporary,
‘afforded him such great matter for joy as to counterbalance
all sadness.’ The ferocious, cruel, and
passionate Bellegarde, who hated this just man more
than he had loved him when both were young, kept
his eyes fixed on him: an obstacle appeared, his horse
reared, and Bellegarde fell; it was thought that he had
broken his leg. There was great confusion; they all
stopped. Some men-at-arms alighted, picked up the
steward, and placing him on his horse, the escort continued
their way, but at a foot-pace. They still went
on, and as they advanced, the magnificent amphitheatre
formed to the south by the Alps spread out more grandly
before them. To the left eastward the graceful slopes
of the Voirons extended as far as Bonne; a little further
on was seen the opening of the valley of Bo&euml;ge,
and further still the Aiguille Verte and other
glaciers, and then much nearer the Mole proudly
raised its pyramidal form; immediately after, but
in the distance, Mont Blanc rose majestically above
the clouds, and the mountains of the Bornes,
running towards the west, completed the picture.
L&eacute;vrier’s escort, after descending into a valley, came
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
in sight of the castle of Bonne, seated on a lofty crest
and commanding the landscape; they climbed the
steep road leading to it, and drew near the castle,
leaving below them a narrow ravine, at the bottom of
which rolls the torrent of Menoge. At last the old
gates were thrown back, they entered the court, and
L&eacute;vrier was handed over to the governor, who shut
him up in a dark cell. As soon as Charles learnt
that all had passed off well, he quitted his retreat
and returned joyful to his lodging. He was confident
that no human power could now deprive him of his
victim.<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">341</a></p>

<p>During this time the city was in great agitation.
Men described with consternation the kidnapping of
the heroic defender of Genevese independence, and all
good citizens gave vent to their indignation. The
deed was an insult to the laws of the state&mdash;it was an
act of brigandage; and hence two sentiments equally
strong&mdash;love for L&eacute;vrier and respect for right&mdash;moved
them to their inmost souls. The council assembled
immediately. ‘About an hour ago,’ said Syndic La
Fontaine, a zealous mameluke, ‘Aim&eacute; L&eacute;vrier was
seized by the duke’s orders, and carried to Plainpalais.’
‘Yes,’ exclaimed several patriots, ‘the duke is keeping
him in the Dominican convent; but we know how to
get him out of that den.’ ‘Resolved,’ say the Minutes,
‘to consider what steps are best to be taken under the
circumstances.’ When they heard that L&eacute;vrier had
been carried from Plainpalais to Savoy, the syndics
went in a body to the bishop’s vicar, and required him
to convene the episcopal council, and to lay before
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
it this unprecedented act of violence. Nobody doubted
that the duke would yield to the remonstrances made
to him. Gruet promptly summoned the members of
the bishop’s council; but these venal men, devoted
to the duke, refused to appear. The next day, the
syndics made another attempt. ‘Since your colleagues
forsake you,’ said they to the vicar-episcopal, ‘go to
his Highness yourself, and make him understand that
he is trampling under foot both the sovereignty of the
bishop and the liberties of the citizens.’ Gruet was
timid, and to appear alone before this powerful noble
terrified him; he applied to two of his colleagues,
De Veigy and Grossi, begging them to accompany him;
but they refused. ‘I will not go alone,’ exclaimed
the frightened man, ‘no ... not at any price! The
duke would kidnap me like L&eacute;vrier.’ Charles’s violent
proceeding struck terror into all those who enjoyed
the privilege of free access to him. Nevertheless
Geneva was in danger. If the most respected of its
citizens were put to death and no one took up their defence,
there would be nothing sacred from the Savoyard
tyrant. L&eacute;vrier’s death might be the death of the
republic. What was to be done? They remembered
one person, the bishop of Maurienne, who was both
a friend of the city and a friend of the duke. The
cold La Fontaine and the impetuous Richardet
hastened to him: ‘Save L&eacute;vrier, or we are all lost!’
they said. The prelate, who was fond of mediating,
and knew very well that he had nothing to fear, immediately
waited upon his Highness.<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">342</a></p>

<p>Charles was not a hero; the emotion of the people
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
disturbed him, the energy of the patriots startled him.
He determined to make an advantageous use of his
perfidy by proposing an exchange: he would spare
L&eacute;vrier’s blood, but Geneva must yield up her liberties.
‘Go,’ he said to Maurienne, ‘and tell the syndics and
councillors of Geneva that, full of clemency towards
them, I ask for one thing only: let them acknowledge
themselves my subjects, and I will give up L&eacute;vrier.’<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">343</a>
The Savoyard bishop carried this answer to the syndics,
the syndics laid it before the council, and Charles
calmly awaited the result of his Machiavellian plot.</p>

<p>The deliberations were opened in the council of
Geneva. When there are two dangers, it is generally
the nearest that affects us most: every day has its
work, and the work of the day was to save L&eacute;vrier.
The ducal courtiers flattered themselves with the
success of this well-laid plot. But the citizens, in this
supreme hour, saw nothing but their country. They
loved Charles’s victim, but they loved liberty more;
they would have given their lives for L&eacute;vrier, but
they could not give Geneva. ‘What! acknowledge
ourselves the duke’s subjects!’ they exclaimed; ‘if
we do so, the duke will destroy our liberties for
ever.<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">344</a> L&eacute;vrier himself would reject the proposal with
horror.’&mdash;‘To save the life of a man,’ they said one to
another in the council, ‘we cannot sacrifice the rights of
a people.’ They remembered how Curtius, to save his
country, had leapt into the gulf; how Berthelier, to
maintain the rights of Geneva, had given his life on the
banks of the Rhone; and one of the citizens, quoting
the words of Scripture, exclaimed in Latin: ‘<i>Expedit</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
<i>ut unus moriatur homo pro populo, et non tota gens
pereat.</i>’<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">345</a> ‘The duke calls for blood,’ they added:
‘let him have it; but that blood will cry out for vengeance
before God, and Charles will pay for his crime.’
The council resolved to represent to the duke, that by
laying hands on L&eacute;vrier he robbed the citizens of their
franchises and the prince of his attributes. Maurienne
carried this answer to his Highness, who persisted in
his cruel decision: ‘I must have the liberties of Geneva
or L&eacute;vrier’s life.’</p>

<p>During these official proceedings, certain noble-hearted
women were greatly agitated. They said to
themselves that when it is necessary to touch the heart,
the weaker sex is the stronger. It was well known that
the haughty Beatrice governed her husband; that she
loved the city, its lake and mountains; that everything
delighted her in this ‘<i>buena posada</i>.’ The ladies who
had danced at her balls, and found her all condescension,
went on Sunday morning to the ducal residence,
and, with tears in their eyes, said to her: ‘Appease
his Highness’s wrath, Madam, and save this good man.’
But the Portuguese princess, faithful to her policy as
to her pride, refused her mediation. She had hardly
done so, when her conscience reproached her; after
that refusal, Beatrice found no pleasure in Geneva;
and before long, leaving the duke behind her, she
went all alone ‘beyond the mountains.’<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">346</a></p>

<p>Moreover it would have been too late. On Sunday
morning, the 11th of March, three men were in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
consultation at the castle of Bonne, and preparing
to despatch L&eacute;vrier. They were Bellegarde, sufficiently
recovered from his fall to discharge his commission
and simulate a trial; a confessor intrusted
to set the accused at peace with the Church; and
the executioner commissioned to cut off his head.
His Highness’s steward, who had received instructions
to have it over ‘in a few hours,’ ordered the
prisoner to suffer the cord&mdash;‘nine stripes,’ says Michel
Roset: ‘not so much from the necessity of questioning
him,’ adds Bonivard, ‘as from revenge.’ This ducal
groom (we mean Bellegarde) felt a certain pleasure
in treating unworthily a magistrate the very representative
of justice. ‘Have you no accomplices who
conspired with you against my lord’s authority?’ said
he to L&eacute;vrier, after the scourging. ‘There are no
accomplices where there is no crime,’ replied the noble
citizen with simplicity. Thereupon the Savoyard provost
condemned him to be beheaded, ‘not because he
had committed any offence,’ say the judicial documents,
but because he was ‘a lettered and learned
man, able to prevent the success of the enterprise of
Savoy.’<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">347</a> After delivering the sentence, Bellegarde
left L&eacute;vrier alone.</p>

<p>He had long been looking death in the face. He
did not despise life, like Berthelier; he would have
liked to consecrate his strength to the defence of
right in Geneva; but he was ready to seal with his
blood the cause he had defended. ‘Death will do me
no evil,’ he said. He called Berthelier to mind, and
the lines written on that martyr of liberty being
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
engraved in his memory, L&eacute;vrier repeated them aloud
in his gloomy dungeon, and then approaching the
wall, he wrote with a firm hand:

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Quid mihi mors nocuit?...<br /></span>
</span></span>

‘Yes,’ said he, ‘death will kill my body and stretch
it lifeless on the ground; but I shall live again;
and the life that awaits me beyond the grave cannot be
taken from me by the sword of the cruellest tyrant.’
He finished the inscription he had begun, and wrote
on the prison wall:

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i20">... Virtus post fata virescit;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nec cruce nec s&aelig;vi gladio perit illa tyranni.<br /></span>
</span></span>

But he thought not of himself alone; he thought upon
Geneva; he reflected that the death of the defenders
of liberty secured its victory, and that it was by this
means the holiest causes triumphed,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Et qu’un sang pr&eacute;cieux, par martyre espandu,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A la cause de Dieu servira de semence.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Shortly after Bellegarde’s departure the confessor
entered, discharged his duty mechanically, uttered
the sentence: <i>Ego te absolvo</i>&mdash;and withdrew, showing
no more sympathy for his victim than the provost
had done. Then appeared a man with a cord: it was
the executioner. It was then ten o’clock at night.
The inhabitants of the little town and of the
adjacent country were sleeping soundly, and no one
dreamt of the cruel deed that was about to cut short
the life of a man who might have shone in the first
rank in a great monarchy. Bellegarde had no cause
to fear that he would be disturbed in the accomplishment
of his crime; still he dreaded the light; there
was in his hardened conscience a certain uneasiness
which alarmed him. The headsman bound the noble
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
L&eacute;vrier, armed men surrounded him, and the martyr
of law was conducted slowly to the castle yard. All
nature was dumb, nothing broke the silence of that
funereal procession; Charles’s agents moved like
shadows beneath the ancient walls of the castle. The
moon, which had not reached its first quarter, was
near setting, and shed only a feeble gleam. It was
too dark to distinguish the beautiful mountains in the
midst of which stood the towers whence they had
dragged their victim; the trees and houses of Bonne
were scarcely visible; one or two torches, carried by
the provost’s men, alone threw light upon this cruel
scene. On reaching the middle of the castle yard,
the headsman stopped and the victim also. The
ducal satellites silently formed a circle round them,
and the executioner prepared to discharge his office.
L&eacute;vrier was calm: the peace of a good conscience
supported him in this dread hour. He thought of
God, of law, of duty, of Geneva, of liberty, and of the
legitimate authority of St. Peter, whom, in the simplicity
of his heart, he regarded as the sovereign of
the city. It was really the prince-bishop whom he
thus designated, but not wishing to utter the name of
a prelate whom he despised, he substituted that of
the apostle. Alone in the night, in those sublime
regions of the Alps, surrounded by the barbarous
figures of the Savoyard mercenaries, standing in that
feudal court-yard, which the torches illumined with
a sinister glare, the heroic champion of the law raised
his eyes to heaven and said: ‘By God’s grace I die
without anxiety, for the liberty of my country and
the authority of St. Peter.’ The grace of God, liberty,
authority&mdash;these main principles of the greatness of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
nations were his last confession. The words had
hardly been uttered when the executioner swung
round his sword, and the head of the citizen rolled in
the castle yard. Immediately, as if struck with fear,
the murderers respectfully gathered up his remains,
and placed them in a coffin. ‘And his body was laid
in earth in the parish church of Bonne, with the
head separate.’ At that moment the moon set, and
black darkness hid the stains of blood which L&eacute;vrier
had left on the pavement of the court-yard.<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">348</a> ‘Calamitous
death,’ exclaims the old <i>Citadin de Gen&egrave;ve</i>,
‘which cost upwards of a million of Savoyard lives
in the cruel wars that followed, in which no one received
quarter, because the unjust death of L&eacute;vrier
was always brought forward.’<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">349</a> There is considerable
exaggeration in the number of Savoyards who, according
to this writer, expiated L&eacute;vrier’s murder by
their death. The crime had other consequences&mdash;and
nobler ones.</p>

<p>Moral victories secure success more than material
victories. Over the corpses of Berthelier and L&eacute;vrier
we might give a christian turn to the celebrated saying:
‘It is the defeated cause that is pleasing to God.’
The triumph of brute force in the castle of Bonne and
in front of C&aelig;sar’s tower agitated, scandalised, and terrified
men’s minds. Tears were everywhere shed over
these two murders.... But patience! These bloody
‘stations’ will be found glorious ‘stations’ leading
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
to the summit of right and liberty. A book has
been written telling the history of the founders of
religious liberty. I may be deceived, but it appears
to me that the narrative of the struggles of the first
huguenots might be entitled: <i>History of the founders
of modern liberty</i>. My consolation when I find myself
called upon to describe events hitherto unknown,
relating to persons unnoticed until this hour, and
taking place in a little city or obscure castle, is, that
these facts have, in my opinion, a European, a universal
interest, and belong to the fundamental principles
of existing civilisation. Berthelier, L&eacute;vrier,
and others have hitherto been only Genevese heroes;
they are worthy of being placed on a loftier pedestal,
and of being hailed by society as heroes of the human
race.</p>

<p>The haste with which the victim had been sacrificed,
the remote theatre of the crime, the hour of
night that had been chosen, all show that Charles had an
uneasy conscience. He soon discovered that he had
not been mistaken in his fears. The indignation was
general. The men of independence took advantage
of the crime that had been committed to magnify the
price of liberty. ‘A fine return,’ they said, ‘for the
honours we have paid Monsieur of Savoy and his
wife!’ Though their anger broke out against the
duke, the bishop had his share of their contempt.
The reflection that he had permitted his friends to be
sacrificed on one side of the Alps while he was amusing
himself on the other, shocked these upright souls.
‘A pretty shepherd,’ they said, ‘who not only abandons
his flock to the wolves, but the faithful dogs also
that watch over it!’ They were disgusted with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
priestly government: some citizens even went so far
as to say: ‘We had better grant Monsieur of Savoy
his request, than let ourselves be murdered for a
prelate who gives us no credit for it. If the duke
takes away certain things, he will at least guarantee
the rest; while the bishop devours us on one side and
lets us be devoured on the other.’<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">350</a> They concluded
that ecclesiastical principalities only served to ruin
their subjects&mdash;at Geneva as well as at Rome.
Liberals and ducals held almost the same language.
The temporal power of the bishop was a worm-eaten
building that would tumble down at the first shock.</p>

<p>When the news of the murder at Bonne was heard
among the young worldlings who frequented the
court, they were aghast, and a change came over
them. All that the duke had done to win them, the
splendid entertainments, the graces of the duchess, the
charms of her ladies, were forgotten. In the ball-room
they could see nothing but Death leaning on his scythe
and with hollow eyes looking round for some new
victim. Their past pleasures seemed a mockery to
them. A brilliant representation had taken place:
on a sudden the curtain fell, the lights were extinguished,
and the most enthusiastic spectators, seized
with terror, hastened to escape far from a place which
appeared to run with blood. That murder, ‘in the
night by torchlight, put all the city in great alarm,’
says a chronicler.</p>

<p>Amid all these cries of indignation, of contempt, of
terror, there was a small group of firm men who saw
the dawn of liberty piercing through the darkness of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
crime. The generous spirits who had received the
Divine Word from France&mdash;Porral, Maison-Neuve,
Vandel, Bernard, even Bonivard&mdash;took courage in
their tears. ‘One single obstacle will check the duke,’
they said, ‘and that obstacle is God! God desires by
means of the duke to chastise Geneva, not destroy it.
The stripes that he inflicts are not for its death, but
for its improvement. Yes! God, after punishing us
with the rod of a father, will rise with the sword in
his hand against those whose crimes he appears to
permit.’<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">351</a></p>

<p>Charles, perceiving the effect produced by the outrage
he had committed, felt ill at ease at Geneva.
Nor was that all; for, learning that a numerous
French army was entering his states on one side,
while the imperial army was advancing on the other,
and that a terrible meeting might ensue, he alleged
this motive for returning to Turin. Wishing, however,
to secure his authority in Geneva, he sent for
Hugues, whose patriotism he feared, reminded him of
the scene just enacted at Bonne, and required him
to promise, upon oath, that he would not take part
in the affairs of the city. Hugues entered into the
required engagement.<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">352</a> Then Charles hastened to
depart, and Bonivard said, with a meaning smile:
‘The duchess having crossed the Alps, the duke
hastens after her&mdash;like a good little canary.’<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">353</a></p>

<p>The Genevans breathed at last: the city was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
without either duke or bishop. L&eacute;vrier’s martyrdom,
which had at first crushed them, now inflamed their
courage. As a steel blade long bent returns back
with a spring, so Geneva, suffering under a blow that
seemed as if it would destroy her, rose up with energy.
More than this; the empty place was soon filled.
Help would come from heaven. The ancient imperial
and episcopal city, not content with having set aside
bishops and dukes, would within a few years place on
the throne Him who exalteth nations. Then, ‘dwelling
in the shadow of the Almighty,’ and sitting tranquilly
at the foot of her beautiful mountains, Geneva
will raise her head, crowned with a twofold liberty.<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">354</a>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.<br />

<span class="small">INDIGNATION AGAINST THE MAMELUKES; THE DUKE APPROACHES
WITH AN ARMY; FLIGHT OF THE PATRIOTS.<br />

(1524-1525.)</span></h2>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> duke had no sooner departed than there was
a general burst of indignation against him, and
against the mamelukes who had delivered up the
greatest of the citizens to his sword. Bernard Boulet,
the city treasurer, was one of the proudest of these
ducal partisans. He had built a fine house, where he
gave splendid entertainments to his party and kept
a good table, by which means he soon squandered
away all his property. But unwilling to renounce
his gay life, he clandestinely appropriated the property
of the State, and still continued to entertain magnificently.
‘Boulet,’ said the huguenots, ‘thinks only
of indulging with his friends in all kinds of pleasure,
in drunkenness, and in voluptuousness. Foppish in
dress, dainty at table, he has no thought for the hunger
and nakedness of the poor. Dissipation, bad
management, fraud, robbery make up his whole life.’
Boulet, who furnished no accounts, owed the city ‘at
least 6,400 florins’<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">355</a>&mdash;a very large sum for those days.
But they feared his influence and malice; and nobody
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
was willing ‘to bell the cat.’ Syndic Richardet, a
good patriot, courageous but hot-headed, entered the
council one day determined to put an end to these
manifest peculations. ‘I call upon the treasurer,’ he
said, ‘to produce the accounts of his office.’ The
embarrassed Boulet attempted to evade the question;
but, being determined to make him give an account of
his conduct, the syndic persisted. The mameluke,
driven into a corner, exclaimed: ‘Are we to be governed
by these <i>huguenots</i>?’&mdash;‘He spoke thus from contempt,’
says Bonivard. The fiery Richardet could not
restrain himself; exasperated because the treasurer
insulted him at the very moment he was discharging
the duties of his office, he acted after the style of
Homer’s heroes, and, raising his syndic’s staff above
the dishonest mameluke, dealt him such a blow that
the staff flew to pieces. It must be remembered that
in the middle ages deeds of violence were sometimes
reckoned lawful. For instance, an old charter bore
that if a respectable man or woman were insulted,
every prud’homme who came up was permitted to
punish such misconduct by one, two, or three blows;
only the prud’homme was required to make oath afterwards
that he had given the blows for the sake of
peace.<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">356</a> There was instantly a great commotion in
the hall; the mameluke councillors uttered cries of
anger; the huguenots protested that Richardet had
acted without their approval; and the syndic, who
was sincere and good at heart, frankly apologised.
Throughout all the disturbance Boulet did not utter
a word; he was secretly calculating the advantages he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
could derive from this assault, and was delighted to
have suffered it. ‘He swallowed it as mild as milk,’
says Bonivard.<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">357</a> Chance, he thought, favoured him,
and had opportunely extricated him from a desperate
position. What a providence in this violent act of
the syndic! The greedy dishonest treasurer would put
on the airs of a martyr; his fidelity to the duke, he
would say, had drawn upon him this savage assault.
He would excite Charles III. against Geneva; he
would urge him to take the city by storm; and in the
midst of all these agitations his accounts would be
forgotten&mdash;which was the essential thing for him.</p>

<p>Boulet did not rejoice alone. His friends the
mamelukes having met, agreed to work this assault
in such a way as to make the blow which had severed
L&eacute;vrier’s head be forgotten. ‘Good!’ said they; ‘we
have now an opportunity of beginning the old dance
again;<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">358</a> that is, to surrender Geneva to Savoy. Go
to Chamb&eacute;ry,’ they continued; ‘make your complaint;
say that you are not safe in this huguenot city, and
entreat his Highness’s council to summon the syndic
who offended you to appear before them&mdash;even at
Chamb&eacute;ry.’</p>

<p>Boulet did all he could to exaggerate his injury.
He bandaged his head, he carried his arm in a sling. In
vain the surgeon assured him that his left arm was but
slightly bruised, and that he had no other wound; no
matter: ‘I will make my complaint to the bishop,’ he
said; ‘I will make it to the duke!’<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">359</a> He would have
gone even to the emperor. The wrath of Achilles, after
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
he had been robbed of Briseis, hardly equalled the
wrath of this wretch, and, in his opinion, Geneva deserved
to receive a punishment as severe as that under
which Troy fell. He had retired across the Arve,
like Pelides to his tent. Some of his friends, his
father-in-law and the judge of Gex in particular,
called upon him and sought to pacify him; but he
remembered the affront that had been done him, and
was implacable. ‘Geneva shall pay dearly for it,’ he
repeated to his friends.</p>

<p>He set out for Chamb&eacute;ry, asked an audience of the
ducal council, and reported the syndic’s violence.
People were very uneasy at Geneva. ‘These Savoyards,’
said the prior of St. Victor, ‘would like nothing
better than to plunder the huguenots.’ The Savoy
bailiffs soon appeared; they set up posts at the bridge
of Arve, at Les Grottes, and at the Mint&mdash;all round
the city&mdash;and fastened letters of citation to them.
The council of Geneva was summoned to appear
before the council of Savoy. That was not all: the
macers (massarii) of the Savoyard council declared
the possessions of the Genevans in Savoy confiscated,
and consequently forbade the farmers and vine-dressers
to till the land or to grind at the mill.
Meadows, fields, vineyards, all were to remain uncultivated.
Hitherto it had pertained to God alone
to send years of famine; now Messieurs of Chamb&eacute;ry
claimed to have the same privilege; and some
Genevese farmers, who had begun to till the earth
with the permission of the local magistrates, were put
in prison by the superior authority. Almost at the
same time other citizens were arrested on frivolous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
pretexts and thrown into one of the dungeons of
Ch&acirc;teau Gaillard. These poor creatures climbed by
turns to the loophole, by means of a beam placed against
the wall, in order to breathe the fresh air and speak
to their wives and children. One day when they
were indulging in this consolation, the beam was taken
away by the duke’s order, and the unhappy wretches
were compelled to crouch at the bottom of their
filthy prison.</p>

<p>Boulet wished, however, to enjoy his triumph; he
longed to set the magistrates at defiance and ask them
whether a blow might not cost them too dear. A
bailiff of Chamb&eacute;ry arrived at Geneva, just as if that
city had been within his jurisdiction, and posted a
‘protection’ on the door of Boulet’s house. This
was a daring usurpation, an insult; but if the
treasurer suffered the least harm, the duke would
consider it as if done to himself. Boulet reappeared,
and had the audacity to show himself at a general
council. This was a little too much: the wretch who
had brought so many calamities upon the citizens,
dared appear among them! Did he hope to receive
another blow? Who can say? The Genevans restrained
themselves; no one raised a hand against
him; but he overheard some persons speaking of his
peculations: ‘I will produce my books and accounts,’
he said. He met with looks that alarmed him.
Suppose they were to put him in prison, as they had
the right, for he was accused of malversation towards
the State. Fearing some mischance, he disappeared
again, and went to beseech the ducal council to
‘vex’ the Genevans. All this was threatening. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
syndics gave orders that prayers should be offered
up and masses sung for the safety of the city.<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">360</a></p>

<p>During this time, the bishop was beginning one of
his frequent evolutions; his rule being to go with the
wind, he turned his prow more to the southward, that
is, towards Savoy. He feared lest the Genevans
should offend the duke, and wrote to them from
Piedmont: ‘So conduct yourselves that <i>God and the
world</i> may have reason to be satisfied.’<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">361</a> He returned
to Geneva, but did not stay there. He ought to have
intervened between the duke and his own subjects,
exposed the serious crimes of the dishonest treasurer,
and prevailed upon the council of Chamb&eacute;ry to withdraw
their violent threats; but though he was both
bishop and prince of the Genevans, he took care not
to do them justice. He escaped to St. Claude,
more sensible to the charms of a worldly life and of
the wine of Arbois, than to the misfortunes of the
city. In his eyes the epitome of wisdom was to
satisfy <i>God and the world</i>, but the seductions of the
world were so attractive that he forgot to be the
friend of God. Some Genevans even asserted that
‘he cared no more for the life to come than a brute
beast.’ Pierre de la Baume had noticed that since
the accession of Clement VII. the house of Savoy
had been in greater favour than ever at the court of
Rome; it was his policy to keep on good terms with
it, to flatter it, in order to obtain a cardinal’s hat
through its influence, as he did a little later. For a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
red hat it was worth while abandoning his sheep to
the wolves.</p>

<p>But if the bishop turned to every wind, the duke
did not. The council of Savoy increased its severity
towards Geneva. Richardet had raised his staff against
one man; Charles raised his against a whole people.
All Geneva was agitated. The citizens besieged the
syndics with their complaints; the syndics assembled
the council. They described the scenes that were
taking place in the country, and all the violence of
Savoy. Two of the noblest magistrates, Syndic Dumont
and Aim&eacute; Girard, hastened to St. Claude to
inform the bishop of the oppressions of the Savoyards.
Girard possessed a lofty soul and impetuous disposition;
he described with such spirit the outrages heaped
upon Geneva, that De la Baume seemed touched, and
promised the Genevans his support. ‘If needs be,’
he exclaimed, ‘I will go to the pope myself.... I will
go to the emperor.... I will beseech them to protect
my good right and the franchises of your city.’ The
deputation was delighted. But the bishop hastened
to restrain himself: the duke, the duke’s power, and the
red hat recurred to his mind. ‘Do not let us be in
a hurry,’ he said more coldly; ‘I shall first send the
noble Albalesta to the duke.’ A month having elapsed,
while Albalesta had obtained nothing, the Genevese
resolved to take their cause into their own hands.
This was what the bishop desired to avoid at any cost.
He swore that he would cite the officers of Savoy
before the pope, under a penalty of 10,000 ducats.<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">362</a>
But Geneva, which placed little trust in the bishop,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
resolved to maintain its independence, and to resist
that foreign Pharaoh who had dared to punish with
barrenness that earth which God waters with the rain
from heaven.</p>

<p>The new campaign required a new leader. Berthelier,
L&eacute;vrier, those noble-hearted men, were no
more.... But there was a third, and he the very man
they required. Besan&ccedil;on Hugues had neither the impulsiveness
of Berthelier nor the firmness of L&eacute;vrier;
but, mild and tender, he felt a love for his country,
the fire of which never ceased to animate him. Moderate,
friendly, and of insinuating manners, he was
able to win over even his enemies, and often exercised
great influence over Pierre de la Baume. Possessing
great physical strength, bold, devoted, never sparing
himself, he braved the most inclement seasons, and
rushed, sword in hand, into the midst of the most
furious enemies. Gifted with a rare discernment,
which permitted him to see clearly into the most
complicated questions, a keen diplomatist, a wise politician,
a warm patriot, he was able by his consummate
wisdom to remove obstacles, by his powerful eloquence
to convince the most obstinate, even the senators of
Berne, and to draw tears from those iron hearts. He
bore in his person a <i>prestige</i> that secured him an
irresistible influence in the councils, and with a few
lines, a few words, he could still the popular waves
ere they came into collision. He has been called the
Nestor, the Sully, the Washington, of Geneva. This
is perhaps saying too much: this Nestor was only
twenty-five when he began his struggles with the
duke, thirty-four at this period of our narrative, and
when he died, two or three years before the final
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
Reformation of Geneva, he was under forty. Yet
Hugues was, on a small scale and on a small stage,
what these great men were on a large one.</p>

<p>The period for electing the syndics having arrived,
it was determined to raise to the chief magistracy
citizens fitted to maintain the rights of the country;
and the name of Hugues was in every mouth. He was
returned, as well as Montyon, Pensabin, and Balard.
With Hugues for their chief, Geneva feared nothing.
But the honest citizen refused the office to which he
had been elected. His friends came round him and
entreated him to accept: he seemed the only pilot
able to steer the ship of the State through the numerous
shoals. ‘The bishop is your friend; he will
protect you,’ they said.&mdash;‘Yes,’ he answered, ‘as he
protected L&eacute;vrier.’&mdash;‘If you refuse,’ said Balard, ‘we
shall refuse also.’&mdash;‘The duke,’ replied Hugues, ‘has
forbidden me personally to meddle in city affairs; I
have given him my promise. L&eacute;vrier’s death has
taught us what the duke’s wrath can do. I would
rather be a confessor than a martyr.’ Did Hugues
give way to a momentary weakness? We may be
allowed to doubt it. He desired to keep the promise
he had made, and had other motives besides.
Thinking that he would be of little use in the council,
and that Geneva must be saved by other means,
he wished to remain free in his movements. But
many could not understand him, and their anger broke
through all restraint. ‘Hugues is wanting in his most
sacred duties,’ they said. These proud republicans
spared nobody. His friend and brother-in-law, the ex-syndic
Baud, captain of the artillery, proposed to the
council-general to deprive him of his citizenship for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
one year. Strange contradiction! almost at the same
moment this man was raised to the head of the republic
and in danger of being expelled from it. But the
people seemed to have an instinctive sentiment that
Hugues would not be wanting at last: ‘He gives
way now,’ they said, ‘only to succeed better hereafter.’
Baud’s proposition was rejected.<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">363</a></p>

<p>Geneva began by a singular measure. The general
council having assembled in the church of St. Pierre
on the 10th of January, 1525, it was resolved to appeal
to the pope against the attacks of Savoy, and delegates
were despatched to lay the appeal before him. The
Genevans were men of precedent: they desired to
have recourse to a tribunal recognised for ages. ‘The
popes,’ observed some of them, ‘are the defenders of
the liberties of the people.’ But others, like Bonivard,
well read in history, shook their heads, and argued
that if princes had been excommunicated by popes,
it was not for having violated the liberties of their
people, but for resisting the ambition of pontiffs.
They mentioned Philip Augustus and Philip the Fair.
The appeal to the pope would serve to show that he
took part with oppressors only. However, the deputies
of Geneva started on their journey. It was ten
years before the day when the Reformation was proclaimed
within its walls. This measure is a remarkable
indication of the peaceful and loyal sentiments
by which the magistrates were animated.</p>

<p>At the same time the syndics waited upon the
bishop’s official; they would have liked for the bishop
himself to plead their cause before the pope. ‘If my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
lord consents to pass the mountains and support us at
Rome,’ said they, ‘we will give him a hundred gold
crowns, and will add five-and-twenty for you.’ The
official smiled: ‘A hundred crowns!’ he said, ‘that
will not be enough to shoe his horses.’&mdash;‘We will give
him two hundred, then,’ answered the syndics. The
bishop, who was always short of money, put this sum
into his purse, and then endeavoured to arrange the
matter without disturbing himself, by merely sending
a deputy to Chamb&eacute;ry.</p>

<p>Never was deputy worse received. The president
of the ducal council, annoyed that so small a city
should dare resist a prince so mighty as his master,
looked contemptuously at the deputy and exclaimed:
‘The duke is sovereign prince of Geneva. What was
Geneva a hundred years ago? a paltry town. Who
is it that made this town into a city? The duke’s
subjects who owe him toll and service.<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">364</a> The
Genevans desire us to cancel the penalties pronounced
against them.... Ha, ha! Messieurs of Geneva, we
will increase them. If within a month from this you
do not make your submission, we will send you so
many soldiers, that you must e’en take the trouble to
obey his Highness.’ The destruction of the liberties
of Geneva seemed to be at hand.</p>

<p>The Genevans now had recourse to the bishop a
second time, and conjured him to pass the Alps.
Between this second demand and the first, many
events had occurred in the political world. Pierre
de la Baume was a zealous agent of the imperialist
party, and the emperor had informed him that he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
wanted him for certain matters. Flattered that
Charles V. should send for him, he appeared to grant
the Genevese their prayer. ‘I will go,’ he said,
and immediately quitted Geneva. Bonivard, who
knew La Baume well, smiled as he saw the simple
burgesses giving their prince-bishop two hundred
crowns to defend them. ‘He is a great spendthrift,’
said the prior, ‘and in his eyes the sovereign virtue
of a prelate consists in keeping a good table and
good wine; he indulges beyond measure. Besides, he
is very liberal to women, and strives to show the
nobility of his descent by great pomp and not by
virtue.... You have given him two hundred crowns ...
what will he do with the money? He will
gamble or squander it away in some other manner.’<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">365</a>
And in fact he had hardly arrived at Turin, when,
without pleading the cause of Geneva, without visiting
Rome to defend it before the pope, he set off instantly
for Milan, where, as agent of Charles V., he plotted
against Francis I. But of the pope and of Geneva,
not a word.</p>

<p>Such was the episcopal tenderness of Pierre de la
Baume. To deliver from foreign and tyrannical
oppression the country of which he was both prince
and bishop was not in his opinion worth the trouble
of taking a single step; but if it were required to go
and intrigue in Lombardy for the potentate whom he
looked upon as the arbiter of the world, a nod was
sufficient to make him hasten thither.</p>

<p>As for the Genevese delegates, Rome saw no more
of them than of their bishop: the court of Turin had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
found the means of stopping them on the road.
Besides, had they reached the banks of the Tiber,
there was no danger that Clement VII. would have
taken up their cause; he would have laughed at
such strange ambassadors. All was going on well
for the duke; he had succeeded in completely isolating
the weak and proud city.<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">366</a></p>

<p>This prince resolved to bring matters to an end
with a restless people who gave him more trouble
than his own states. He quitted Turin, crossed the
mountains, and ‘lodged at Annecy,’ says Bonivard.
In order to succeed, he resolved to employ a smiling
lip and a strong hand; the use of such contrary
means was as natural as it was politic in him:
Charles was always blowing hot and cold. If Geneva
sent him deputies, he said: ‘Upon the honour of a
gentleman, I desire that the letters I have granted in
your favour should be observed.’ But another day,
the same man who had appeared as gentle as a lamb
became as fierce as a wolf; he had the deputies seized
and thrown into dungeons, as well as any Genevans
who ventured into his territories. The soldiers ransacked
the country-houses lying round Geneva, carried
away the furniture, and drank the wine; they also
cut off the supplies of the city, which was a scandalous
violation of the most positive treaties.<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">367</a></p>

<p>Still the appeal to Rome made the duke uneasy.
The prince of Rome was a priest, the prince of
Geneva was a priest also: Charles feared that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
two priests would play him some ugly trick behind
his back. He determined, therefore, to employ intrigue
rather than force, to induce the people to
confer on him the superior jurisdiction, which would
put him in a position to monopolise the other rights
of sovereignty; he resolved to ask for it as if he were
doing the Genevese a great favour. Accordingly on
the 8th of September the vidame appeared before the
council as if he had come to make the most generous
proposition in behalf of his Highness. ‘On the one
hand,’ he said, ‘you will withdraw the appeal from
Rome; and on the other, the duke will put an end
to all the annoyances of which you complain.’ And
then he demanded the superior jurisdiction in Geneva
for the duke, as if it were mere surplusage. Charles
expected this time to attain his end. Indeed, his
numerous partisans in the city, seeing that the decisive
moment had arrived, everywhere took up the
matter warmly. ‘Let us accept,’ said the mameluke
Nergaz. ‘If we refuse these generous proposals, our
property and our fellow-citizens will never be restored,
and none of us will be able to leave our narrow
territory without being shut up in his Highness’s
prisons.’&mdash;‘Let us accept,’ answered all the ducal
partisans. Geneva was about to become Savoyard;
and the humble but real part reserved for her in
history would never have existed. Then the most courageous
patriots&mdash;Besan&ccedil;on Hugues, Jean Philippe,
the two Bauds, Michael Sept, Syndic Bouvier, who
had been named in place of Hugues, Ami Bandi&egrave;re,
the two Rosets, John P&eacute;colat, and John Lullin&mdash;exclaimed:
‘If we love the good things of this life so
much, our only gain will be to lose them and our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
liberty with them. The duke entices us to-day, only
to enslave us to-morrow. Let us fear neither exile,
nor imprisonment, nor the axe. Let us secure the independence
of Geneva, though it be at the price of our
blood.’ Even Bouvier, a weak and wavering character,
was electrified by these noble words, and added:
‘Rather than consent to this demand, I will leave the
city and go to Turkey!’ ... ‘No compromise with
the duke!’ repeated all the independents. The mamelukes
persisted: they pointed to the fields lying fallow,
to the Genevans in prison ... and without touching
upon the question of the superior jurisdiction (for
that was inadmissible) they demanded that the appeal
of Geneva against the duke should be withdrawn.
There was a majority of eleven in favour
of this proposition; forty-two votes were given against
it, and fifty-three for it. It was strange that the
huguenots supported the appeal to the pope. The
pope (very innocently, it must be confessed) seemed
to be on the side of liberty.... The party of independence
was vanquished.<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">368</a></p>

<p>Charles was not satisfied, however. He hated these
majorities and minorities, and all these republican
votes; he wanted a passive and unanimous obedience;
he attended only to the votes of the minority, and
meditated setting every engine to work to get rid of
the forty-two huguenots who opposed his designs.
At court they were delighted with the result; they
made a jest of the forty-two independents who had
had the simplicity to give their names, and thus point
themselves out to the court of Turin as persons to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
despatched first of all. The list was read over and
over again: they picked it to pieces&mdash;a sarcasm
against this man, an insult against that. All necessary
measures were taken for the great act of
purification which was to be accomplished. The
duke gave orders to move up the army that was to
enter the city and free it from the rebels.</p>

<p>The enemies of Geneva were not less active within
than without. The vidame, a servile agent of Charles,
assembled the chiefs of the mamelukes in his house.
As all the citizens whose deaths they desired were not
included among the forty-two, they occupied themselves
at these meetings in drawing up proscription
lists. Vidame, mamelukes, Savoyards, congratulated
each other on ‘cutting off the heads of their adversaries,’
and wrote down the names of many of the
best citizens.<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">369</a> The disease, according to these conspirators,
had spread widely; it was necessary to
get rid of the friends of independence at one blow
and not singly. They prepared to seize the patriots
in the city, and to slay them outside the city; the
parts were distributed; this man will arrest, that
man will try, and the other will put to death. At
the same time, to prevent the free Genevans from
escaping, the duke stationed soldiers on every road.
Geneva will be very fortunate if it escapes the plot this
time, and if it does not see its old liberties and its new
hopes of the Gospel and of reformation perish under
the sword of Savoy.</p>

<p>Charles III., leading the way to Charles IX., began
his persecution of the huguenots. He commenced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
with his own territories, where he could do as he
pleased; Pierre de Malbuisson was seized at Seyssel;
Beffant at Annecy; Bullon was arrested on Sunday
(frightful sacrilege in the eyes of the catholics!) in
the church of Our Lady of Grace, during high mass.
‘That matters not,’ said the ducal party; ‘there are
cases where the privileges of the Church must give
way to the interests of the State.’ During this time,
the patriots remaining at Geneva went up and down
the city, showing themselves brave even to imprudence,
and boldly demanded the convocation of a
general council of the people to annul the division
which by a majority of eleven had given such satisfaction
to the duke. This inflamed Charles’s anger
to the highest degree; he swore to be avenged of
such an insult, and everything was prepared to crush
these audacious citizens. The sky grew dark; a dull
murmur was heard in the city; there was a general
uneasiness; every man asked his neighbour what was
going to happen ... alarm was everywhere.</p>

<p>At last the storm burst. It was the 15th of September.
One, two, three&mdash;several persons not known
in Geneva, peasants, or tradespeople, and men of
little importance, appeared at the gates: they were
messengers sent to the patriots by their friends and
relations settled in Savoy. One message succeeded
another. The ducal army is in motion, they were
told; it is preparing to quit the villages where it was
stationed. Leaders and soldiers declare loudly that
they are going to Geneva to put the duke’s enemies
to death. Nothing else can be heard but threats,
boasts, and shouts of joy.... A few minutes later the
people of the neighbourhood ran up and announced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
that the army was only a quarter of a league distant.
The people hastened to the higher parts of the city:
they saw the arquebusiers, halberdiers, and flags; they
heard the drums and fifes, the tramp of the march, and
the hurrahs of the soldiers. The Savoyards were in the
fields and the mamelukes in the streets. It was not
even possible for the citizens to expose themselves to
death on the ramparts. The ducal faction would not
permit them to approach. ‘Make your escape,’ said
some to the huguenot leaders; ‘if you delay an instant,
you are lost.’ The mamelukes lifted their heads and
exclaimed: ‘Now is the day of vengeance!’</p>

<p>The noble citizens threatened by the sword of
Charles, or rather by the axe of his executioners,
wished to come to some understanding with each
other, but they had not the time to confer together.
They knew the fate that awaited them, and the alarm
of their friends and wives, of those who had nothing
to fear, drove them out like a blast of wind. Some
would have sold their lives dearly; others said that
their task was not yet completed, that if the duke
attacked them perfidiously, if the bishop basely
abandoned them, they must retire elsewhere, pray for
the hour of justice, and procure powerful defenders
for Geneva. Their resolution was hardly formed
when the field-sergeants approached the gates. The
huguenots pursued by the sword of Savoy could
neither carry away what would be necessary during
their exile, nor take leave of their friends; people in
the streets had hardly time to enter their houses.
All departed amid the tears of their wives and the
cries of their children.</p>

<p>The exodus began, not the exodus of a whole
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
people, but of the flower of the citizens. Many were
seen leaving the gates of the city. There was Jean
Baud, captain of the artillery, with his brother Claude,
a zealous episcopalian, but a friend of independence;
Girard, who had succeeded Boulet as treasurer of the
city; Jean Philippe, afterwards first syndic; the
intrepid Jean Lullin, Hudriot du Molard, and Ami
Bandi&egrave;re, who were syndics in the year of the Reformation;
Jean d’Arloz, afterwards one of the Council
of Two Hundred; Michael Sept, a frequent deputy to
Switzerland; G. Peter, Claude Roset, father of the
celebrated syndic and chronicler; J. L. Ramel, Pierre
de la Thoy, Chabot, and P&eacute;colat. Others quitted
Geneva secretly; some by day, some by night, in disguise,
on foot or on horseback, ‘in great haste, by
different roads, without consulting one another.’ Some
crept along the edge of the lake, others hastened
towards the mountains. Melancholy dispersion, sad
calamity!<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">370</a> And yet as they departed, these generous
men kept up the hope of seeing liberty victorious.
In this dread and critical hour, they cast
their eyes over the walls of the old city, and swore
that they left it not to escape death, but to save it
from oppression. They were going in search of
help&mdash;not towards the enslaved banks of the Tiber,
as they did once in their folly; but towards those
noble mountains of Switzerland, which had thrown
off the yoke of foreign tyrants. The sword of Savoy
pursues them; but, wonderful providence of God! it
drives them towards those countries where a new
light has dawned, and where they will meet at nearly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
every step the friends of Zwingle and of the Reformation.
It is a prince, a friend of the pope, that is
sending them to the school of the Gospel.</p>

<p>The most threatened of all was Besan&ccedil;on Hugues:
if he had been taken, his head would have been the
first to fall. At that time he happened to be at a farm
he possessed at Chatelaine, a short distance from Geneva,
in the direction of Gex. He was serious, but
calm, for he felt the importance of the crisis, and was
tranquilly preparing to gather his grapes, for it was
vintage time. On the evening of the 15th of September
he received a visit from his friend Messire Vuillet,
commandant of Gex, who rode up on horseback, and
asked him, with an air of frankness, to give him a bed
for the night. Hugues had no suspicion; the horse
was put into the stable; a room was prepared for
Vuillet, and the two friends, sitting down at table,
talked a long while over their supper. The commandant
of Gex, commissioned by the duke to arrest
Hugues, had ordered his officers to be at Chatelaine
early in the morning of the 16th; and to make sure of
not losing his victim, he had thought the cleverest
way was to come and sup as a friend with the man
whom he was to deliver up to the death of Berthelier
and of L&eacute;vrier, to sleep under his roof, to arrest him
next morning, and hand him over to the executioners.
Hugues as yet knew nothing of what was
going on at Geneva.</p>

<p>The flight had already become general: the huguenots
hurried away, some in the direction of Friburg
by way of Lausanne; others to St. Claude, by the
Jura. The bishop, as we have said, had gone into
Italy, probably in March, six months before; but he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
had devoted partisans at St. Claude. Accordingly
the fugitives, who still hoped something from the
episcopal power, took the latter road. Let us follow
the first of these two companies.</p>

<p>At the head of those who had taken the road to
Switzerland were De la Thoy and Chabod. They
galloped their horses full speed along the Lausanne
road; on reaching Versoix, they fell unexpectedly
into the midst of the soldiers posted there with orders
to stop the Genevans in their flight. De la Thoy,
who was well mounted, gave his horse the spur, and
escaped; but Chabod was taken and carried to Gex.
The news of this arrest spread immediately, and caused
great trouble among the fugitives who followed them.
They threw themselves into the by-roads, they skirted
the foot of the mountains, and in vain did Charles’s
men-at-arms follow in their track: many of them
arrived at Lausanne. Yet it was Friburg they wished
to reach, and to do that they had to cross difficult
passes where the duke had stationed his soldiers in
order to seize them. The Sieur d’Englisberg, avoyer
of Friburg, possessed vineyards on the shores of the
Lake of Geneva, and was gathering his grapes at La
Vaux. While busy with his vats and presses, he
learnt what was going on, and, full of compassion for
the unhappy men, he sent off a courier to his colleagues.
The Friburg council immediately despatched
an officer with thirty horsemen, with orders to protect
the fugitive huguenots.</p>

<p>During this time, those who had taken the road to
Franche-Comt&eacute; (the bishop’s followers) crossed the
Jura mountains and ‘made a thousand windings to
escape,’ says Bonivard. They walked but little during
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
the day, much during the night; they flung themselves
into the woods and scaled the rocks. These worthy
episcopalians fancied that it would be sufficient to see
their pastor’s face and be saved. And even if he had
not returned to St. Claude, that city would afford
them a secure asylum. But, cruel disappointment!
not only was there no bishop, but his officers repulsed
his persecuted subjects. Nobody in the city
would give shelter even to the most catholic of the
fugitives.</p>

<p>The Genevans, disappointed in their expectations
and disconcerted in their plans, determined to continue
their flight. It was indeed time: just as they
were leaving St. Claude by one gate, the Savoyard
soldiers entered by another. Terror added wings to
their feet; they hurried along, the rain beating upon
them, the horsemen following them hard, at every
moment on the brink of falling into the hands of their
enemies, and the dangers of their country adding to
the wretchedness of their flight. At last they arrived
at Besan&ccedil;on, then at Neufchatel, and finally at Friburg,
where they met their friends who had come by way of
Lausanne. They embraced and grasped each other’s
hands. But Besan&ccedil;on Hugues ... they sought him
everywhere ... he could not be found. The anxiety
was general. It was known what zeal the ducal
archers would have employed to seize him; it was
besides so easy to surprise him in his quiet retreat at
Chatelaine. Alas! the murderers of C&aelig;sar’s tower
and of the castle of Bonne might perhaps already
have shed the blood of a third martyr!</p>

<p>Hugues and the governor of Gex had passed the
evening together; and as the Genevan had, says a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
manuscript, ‘a keener scent than his treacherous
friend,’ he had led on Vuillet to speak of the circumstances
of the times, and had guessed the object of his
visit. He had learnt that the only means of saving
Geneva was to claim the support of the Swiss. The
hour for retiring had come; Hugues with a cheerful
look conducted the commandant to the room prepared
for him, and bade him good night. The latter had
hardly fallen asleep when, saddling his guest’s horse,
Hugues galloped off with one or two companions;
they took the direction of St. Claude, intending to go
from thence to Friburg. At daybreak he found himself
on the summit of the mountain of Gex, and at
the pass of La Faucille bade farewell to the beautiful
valley of the Leman, on which the rays of the rising
sun were beginning to fall.</p>

<p>At this moment Messire Vuillet awoke, got up
noiselessly, and, seeing from the window that his
soldiers were posted round the house, stealthily advanced
to seize his prey.... The bed was empty, the
bird had flown. The commandant of Gex immediately
ordered the door to be opened, summoned the
provost-marshal, and directed him to pursue the
fugitive with the duke’s cavalry. The squadron set
off at a gallop. Some hours earlier, the archers of Gex
had started in pursuit of the other fugitives, making
sure of catching them. The road across the mountains
wound about in consequence of the valleys and
precipices, so that pursuers and pursued, being sometimes
on opposite slopes, might see and even hear one
another, although there was an abyss between them.
When the flight of Hugues was made known, the zeal
of the soldiers increased; and the former, knowing his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
danger, threw himself into impassable roads in order
to escape his enemies. ‘Ah!’ said he afterwards, ‘it
was not pleasant; for the archers of Monsieur of
Savoy followed us as far as St. Claude, then from St.
Claude to Besan&ccedil;on and beyond.... We were forced
to journey day and night, through the woods, through
the rain, not knowing where to find a place of safety.’
At length he reached Friburg, six days after the
arrival of his friends who had gone by Lausanne.
Friburgers and Genevese, all welcomed him with
transport.<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">371</a>

<span class="small">THE FUGITIVES AT FRIBURG AND BERNE. THE DUKE AND THE
COUNCIL OF HALBERDS AT GENEVA.<br />

(<span class="smcap">September to December 1525.</span>)</span></h2>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">A Striking</span> sight was that presented by the
city founded by the Zœhringens. Strange
men were wandering round the old cathedral and on
the steep and picturesque banks of the Sarine. The
people of Friburg looked at them with respect, for they
knew that these citizens, the victims of the tyranny
of a foreign power, had come to seek an asylum
within their walls. They went to the windows to see
them pass, and approached them with cordial affection.
The Friburgers wished to hear them, and Besan&ccedil;on
Hugues, accompanied by a number of the fugitives,
was introduced into the council-hall. They gave him
a seat on the right of the avoyer, which was the place
of honour, and the sitting being opened, the Genevan
rose and said: ‘Most honoured lords, there is a town
situated at the natural limits of Switzerland&mdash;a town
entirely devoted to you, where you can come and go
just as at home, where you can bargain, sell, and buy
whatever you require, and which would be able to stop
your enemies, if ever the League should be attacked
from the south. This town, the complement of Helvetia,
ought to be allied to the cantons. Did not the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
Swiss in the time of C&aelig;sar extend as far as L’Ecluse?<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">372</a> ...
If Geneva should fall into the hands of Savoy,
the cannon that ought to defend you will be turned
against you.... Gentlemen, time presses, the fatal
moment is at hand.... Long, unjust, and violent persecutions
have placed our liberties on the brink of the
abyss. The heroic Berthelier murdered at the foot
of C&aelig;sar’s tower; the wise L&eacute;vrier beheaded in the
castle yard of Bonne; Malbuisson, Chabod, and many
others recently flung into gloomy dungeons; all our
friends remaining at Geneva in danger of losing their
lives ... and we, most honoured lords, who are before
you, obliged to abandon our property, our business,
our families, our country, that we may not fall into
the hands of a prince who has sworn our death: to
such a state is our free and ancient city reduced....
One thing alone can save it ... the strong hand of the
Swiss League.... Most honoured lords, hear our cries,
behold our tears, and have compassion on our misery.
For God’s honour, give us aid and counsel.’</p>

<p>The fugitives who stood around Hugues&mdash;Lullin,
Girard, the two Bauds, Bandi&egrave;re, Sept, P&eacute;colat, and
about twelve other citizens&mdash;were deeply moved.
These men, men of great energy, appeared as suppliants
before the senate of Friburg. Their countenance, their
words, entreated this powerful city, and yet a noble
pride was visible in their looks. They felt at once
their independence and their misery; they had the air
of dethroned kings. Some wrung their hands, others
shed tears; all prayed with tones of sorrow that the
Swiss would come to their assistance. The Friburgers,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
touched with pity for Geneva and its exiles, and filled
with indignation against Charles and his partisans,
replied: ‘No, we will not desert you.’ Words full
of kindness, which consoled men overwhelmed with
sorrows, and shed a ray of light upon their gloomy
path!</p>

<p>The moment was favourable for gaining the Swiss:
they were exasperated at seeing Savoy, after the battle
of Pavia, basely embrace the cause of the conqueror.
In going to the support of Geneva, Switzerland the
faithful would give a wholesome lesson to that power
which always took the strongest side. Friburg immediately
despatched deputies to Berne and Soleure, and
some of the fugitives accompanied them. In these
two cities the unfortunate Genevans renewed their
touching supplications. At Berne, says a chronicler,
‘they found a bad beginning but a good end;’ at
Soleure, the contrary, ‘a good beginning but a bad
end.’ Soleure, however, joined the two other cities in
notifying to the duke, that if he valued their friendship
he must cease injuring Geneva. But Berne in
particular showed great zeal. There were already in
that city a number of devoted friends of Zwingle and
the Reformation; among others one of the chief magistrates,
Thomas ab Hofen, an intelligent and moderate
man, of a temper inclined to melancholy, much employed
in the public business of his country, and who
for two years had been corresponding with the
reformer of Zurich. These evangelical Bernese soon
perceived that there was a hidden but real relationship
between the reformation of Zurich and the emancipation
of Geneva; and they influenced their countrymen
in favour of the Genevans. At the same time they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
spoke of the Gospel to the fugitives, and some of those
men who had come to Switzerland in search of liberty
only, found the truth. This movement of the powerful
republic towards Geneva preluded new times.
Savoy had desired to crush that liberty which was
of such old standing in Geneva, and the Reformation
which was soon to begin; but, by the wonderful providence
of God, the blow intended to kill both secured
their existence and gave them a wider development.
The word of the reformers, well received by the
Bernese people, was to arrive even at Geneva, and that
city would thus, by God’s counsel, receive from Switzerland
not only national independence, but blessings
that extend far beyond the destinies of nations.<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">373</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the duke had been told of the departure
of the fugitives: just as he was going to lay his hand
upon the nest, the birds disappeared. Charles and his
counsellors were staggered. These energetic citizens
would in truth be no longer in Geneva to combat his
designs; but it would have been surer, he thought, to
put them out of the way either by the sword of the
executioner or by a long imprisonment. Charles the
Good had often practised both these means with success.
In vain did his partisans say, to comfort him,
that at least the patriots would not offend him by their
presence. Yes, but if they should return&mdash;if they
should not return alone&mdash;if the Swiss.... There were
in the Helvetic League confused noises, distant sounds
of Reformation and of liberty, which alarmed the
Savoyards. Yet they said, if we profit skilfully by
the absence of the huguenots, if we properly muzzle
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
the other Genevans, if we establish ourselves firmly in
the city, nobody will be able to turn us out.</p>

<p>And now, as there was no need to hurry, the duke
resolved to put off his entrance for a while. The appeal
to Rome had wounded him deeply. To see himself,
a sovereign prince, head of the most glorious
house in Europe, uncle of the king of France, brother-in-law
of the emperor, summoned before the pope by
a band of nobodies, greatly incensed the vain and
haughty Charles III. Before he enters Geneva, the
appeal must be withdrawn. The duke sent orders
on this subject to M. de Balleyson, his representative
in the city. Then, as if to pass away the time,
he urged on the persecution of all the Genevans
around him. The Sieur of Bonebouges, brother to
the Sieur of Montrotier, at the head of the troops of
Faucigny, good soldiers but violent men, plundered
the country, seized many respectable people in the
environs of the city, and shut them up in the castles
of Savoy, where they were grossly maltreated.</p>

<p>De Balleyson lost no time in executing his master’s
orders. He represented to the principal friends of
Savoy at Geneva of what an offence the city had been
guilty towards the duke by daring to accuse him before
the pope. On the 20th of September the general
council was convoked. Alas! those energetic men
who had so often been its glory, Hugues and his companions
in misfortune, were absent, and nearly all the
friends they still possessed in Geneva refused to
attend. M. de Balleyson appeared before this shadow
of a general council and said: ‘Our lord the duke
wishes to learn from the people of this city of Geneva
whether they intend to prosecute a certain appeal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
before the court of Rome.’<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">374</a> The mamelukes, who
were almost alone in the council, shouted out as if
with one voice: ‘It is not our wish to prosecute
the said appeal.’<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">375</a></p>

<p>This matter being ended, the duke prepared to
make his entrance into the city, which he did in the
last days of September with a part of the troops
which he had ‘beyond the Arve.’ He found Geneva
very different from what he had desired. He had
hoped to seize the rebels there, and he found none
but slaves. The servile mamelukes cared little for
liberty, and were proud to have a master. They
called him their ‘most dread lord,’ approached him
with base adulation, and, kissing the chains he brought
them, assured him that his coming filled them with
joy and comfort.</p>

<p>The duke, who set little store by such cringing
men, thought only how he could become prince of
the city, and intrigued to get the sovereign authority
handed over to him. His ministers had conceived a
plan which promised fairly, and the necessary manœuvres
were immediately resorted to. The syndics
having appeared before his Highness on the 29th of
September (1525), the duke said to them rather abruptly:
‘The expenses and fines imposed on Geneva by
my council of Chamb&eacute;ry amount to twenty thousand
gold crowns.’ He desired to frighten the Genevans,
and induce them to sacrifice their independence in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
exchange for this debt. But the syndics contented
themselves with answering: ‘Monseigneur, the city is
poor, and we can only offer you ... our hearts.’ This
was not what Charles wanted. The duke’s chancellor,
taking the syndics aside, said to them: ‘Come, gentlemen,
put yourselves straight, do <i>something</i> to satisfy
his Highness.’ The syndics reflected for two or
three days, and unable or unwilling to guess what
that ‘something’ could be, they said to the vidame,
the lawful channel between them and the prince:
‘What does the duke mean?’ The vidame conferred
with his master, and appearing before the council
on the 10th of October, he said: ‘The duke is vicar-imperial
and sovereign of the cities included within
his states; Geneva is so included. Why do you not
then acknowledge him as your master? Do not be
afraid; he is a kind prince; he will respect the authority
of the bishop and the franchises of the city, and
you will enjoy a prosperity hitherto unknown.’ This
was clearer: the Savoyard prince said plainly that
he wanted Geneva. The vidame, observing that his
hint had been received without enthusiasm, added:
‘If you do not accept the duke willingly, you will be
made to accept him by force.’ The servile mamelukes,
magnifying the advantages of annexation to so
powerful a state, would have granted everything on
the spot. The moment was critical: the syndics
were uneasy and wavering. On the one hand was
the ancient independence of their country; on the
other, superior and brute force, which none of them
could resist. They referred his Highness’s demand
to the episcopal council, which in turn referred it to
the prince-bishop in person. Such a reply was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
already a concession; the politicians of Savoy fancied
themselves near their object.... Geneva consents,
they will say to the bishop; you cannot answer us by
a refusal. The city was on the verge of ruin when
an unexpected and noble succour preserved it.<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">376</a></p>

<p>What Charles had so much dreaded came to pass.
Towards the end of October, several stout men of
warlike mien and proud look were seen entering
by the Swiss gate: they were ambassadors from
Berne, Friburg, and Soleure, with Gaspard de Mullinen
of Berne at their head. This energetic man
was a good catholic; in 1517 he had made a pilgrimage
to Jerusalem, and had been created knight
of the Holy Sepulchre. A blind conservative, he
was conscientiously and steadfastly opposed to every
change, religious or political. ‘Confederates,’ said
he continually in the diets, ‘resist the doctrine of
Luther, or we shall soon be overrun by it.’<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">377</a> It
would seem as if Mullinen ought to have supported
the prince’s pretensions with his iron hand; but in
his sight the attempt of Savoy was contrary to treaty,
and consequently a revolutionary work. Seeing,
therefore, that the Genevese council were wavering,
the indignant Bernese went to their place of meeting,
and said: ‘Stand firm and fear nothing; our lords
will support you in all your rights.’<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">378</a></p>

<p>This intervention on the part of the Swiss disconcerted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
the duke. He must change his plan, and have
recourse to stratagem in order to free himself from
this knight of the Holy Sepulchre. Never were
diplomatists more successful in deceiving rude warriors
and honest citizens. First, Charles’s ministers
put the mamelukes forward, who began telling the
ambassadors: ‘We desire to live under the protection
of the duke and the bishop.’ Next, Charles declared
to the Swiss that he was full of love for all the citizens
of Geneva, and ready to grant everything the cantons
required. ‘The fugitives may return,’ he added.
‘Here is a safe-conduct for them: take it to them.’
The document was placed in Mullinen’s hands. He
was astonished at the rapid success of his embassy.
He turned the paper over and over, without reading
it however, and for a good reason. The safe-conduct
was in Latin, and the knight of Mullinen with his
noble colleagues did not pretend to any knowledge of
that language; but how could they suppose that the
duke had not given them, as he assured them, complete
satisfaction? They imagined that the document,
while it secured life and liberty to the fugitives,
would open to them the gates of Geneva; and doubting
not that Besan&ccedil;on Hugues, Lullin, Girard, and
their friends, on their return to the city, would be
able to preserve its independence, they thanked the
duke and departed satisfied for their homes.<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">379</a></p>

<p>But Hugues was a better Latin scholar and knew
his man better than Mullinen. As soon as the ambassador
returned, he handed to the Genevese, with an air
of triumph, the important paper that was the reward of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
his journey, and Hugues read it eagerly. On coming
to the last phrase he smiled bitterly: <i>Dummodo non
intrent civitatem, nec suburbia ejus</i>, said the safe-conduct;
‘which means,’ said Hugues to the deputies,
‘that we can return to Geneva provided we do not
enter the city or the suburbs.... The duke will be
within and we without.... What services can we
render the city? You know the smallness of our
territory. If we are neither in the city nor in the
suburbs, we are on the lands of Savoy.... Now if Berthelier
was arrested close under the walls (at La Treille),
if L&eacute;vrier was seized at the very gate of St. Pierre,
what would befall us on the ducal territory?...
The duke is laying a snare: it is a condition which
nullifies the act.&mdash;The bird which the duke has sent
us,’ he added, ‘has a fine head and beautiful plumage;
but there is a tail at the end which spoils all the
rest.’&mdash;‘This grace is a mere trap,’ said the indignant
exiles. The knight of Mullinen was offended and
annoyed at the manner in which the Duke of Savoy
had befooled him, and perhaps began to imagine that
a knowledge of Latin might be of use. ‘My lords,’
said the fugitives to the councils of Berne and Friburg,
‘the duke is a great traitor. He fears not God,
but he fears men the more. For this reason, make us
free of your cities; for if he knows that we are your
allies, then only will he leave us in peace.’<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">380</a> At the
same time the Genevans, wishing to show the duke
what confidence they placed in his safe-conduct, sent
for their wives and children. This was making an
energetic answer to Savoy.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span></p>

<p>The poor Genevese women with hearts full of bitterness
began their journey. Women did not travel
much at the beginning of the sixteenth century; and
these, who had hardly been out of Geneva, thought,
as they went to Friburg and Berne, that they were
going almost to the end of the world. What a sad
journey was theirs! Frightened at the real or supposed
dangers of the road, surprised at the strange
language whose unintelligible sounds began to echo
in their ears, bathed in tears, and broken-hearted, they
folded the poor children in their arms; for they were
terrified at the strange scenes and new faces, and
clung with their weak hands round their mothers’
necks. At length this troop of afflicted women
entered Friburg; but their arrival at first only increased
the distress, and when these loving wives
embraced their husbands, their tears of joy were
mingled abundantly with tears of sorrow. The
‘foreigners,’ as they were called, although of respectable
families, were at that time destitute of everything,
and were almost like beggars at the doors of
their friends. At the first moment they were compelled
to leave their families in the street, not knowing
where to shelter them. It was a heart-rending time.
What! not a room, not even a stable where these
exhausted women and children could lie upon the
straw! The afflicted mothers pressed the little creatures
to their bosom&mdash;kissed their pale lips ... and
then regretted Geneva.</p>

<p>At length the foreigners took courage and went
before the council. ‘We sent for our families,’ they
said, ‘but we can neither lodge them nor feed them....
Permit them to enter the hospital.’ The prayer was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
granted, and these well-born women who not long ago
were robed in silk and dancing with Beatrice of Portugal,
were seen exchanging the palace for a hospital.
‘The people were moved to pity,’ says Bonivard. It
must be remembered, however, that in those times
staying in a hospital was not degrading: travellers
often lodged in such places.<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">381</a></p>

<p>The arrival of the women and children at first
increased the distress of the citizens; they were discouraged
and seemed to have reached the depths of
misery. The sight of these beloved beings reminded
them of Geneva and softened their hearts. But on a
sudden they roused themselves; they went from Friburg
to Berne; they spoke in private houses, in the
halls of the tribes, in the public places, and appealed
to the sympathy of the Swiss. They represented
that the duke had put their leaders to death; that he
had forced them to forsake their homes and their
business, and to fly to a foreign land; that, being
reduced to the greatest poverty, they had been compelled
to place their wives in a position which they
would once have rejected with contempt, and that, to
put a climax to this misery, the city which they loved,
and for whose independence they were ready to sacrifice
everything, was invaded and enslaved.... These
great souls were troubled; these proud citizens, so
resolute before the face of a cruel prince, were depressed
in the presence of their afflicted families, of
their exile, of the ruin of Geneva, and tears betrayed
their weakness. The Bernese looked with admiration
on these noble citizens, whose tattered garments
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
bore witness to their wretched condition. Many of
the tribes of the city of Berne and the majority of
the Council of Two Hundred declared for the vanquished
cause, and the conclusion of an alliance with
Geneva seemed near at hand.</p>

<p>The bishop, already alarmed by Charles’s intrigues,
was startled when he heard of this. If Berne accepted
the reformed doctrine like Zurich, if Geneva should
follow the example of Berne, the prelate seated in the
chair of the bishops and on the throne of princes,
would see them both taken from under him. Pierre
de la Baume, like many ecclesiastical sovereigns, cared
nothing for the welfare of those whom he called his
subjects; but he cared a great deal for the title of
prince, and would not suffer either the duke or the
Swiss to deprive him of it. In order to preserve it,
he would have convoked the whole world, had that
been possible. Accordingly, even when at table, he
felt uneasy and would pause frequently, musing with
himself and saying: ‘The duke is at Geneva; the fox
in the poultry-yard.... Let the fowls look out!...
And then, on the other hand, they are playing tricks
in the cantons.... The bears look as if they wished to
descend from the mountains.... Unhappy shepherd!...
I will do anything,’ he said, ‘to preserve the
jurisdiction of the Church.’ He began at once, and
endeavoured first to coax his flock:<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">382</a> ‘We are very
glad to hear of your good disposition,’ he wrote to
them; ‘and you will do us great pleasure by informing
us of all that is necessary for the welfare of our dear
city.... Do you, on your part, so conduct yourselves
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
that God and the world may have cause to be satisfied.’<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">383</a>
In 1525, as in 1523, the prelate’s device was still <i>God
and the world</i>.</p>

<p>These efforts came to nothing. The government
of bishops and princes, established in different parts
of christendom, was at first mild and paternal, compared
with the government of certain lay lords;
but long ago, the bishops had lost the superiority
which could legitimatise their authority, and the lay
power had, on the contrary, gained great influence
in the world. In France, especially since the thirteenth
century, royalty, by displaying a character of
kindness, had favoured the progress of the people in
things material, intellectual, and even moral; and if
Francis I., notwithstanding a personal character by no
means estimable, holds a brilliant place in history, it
must be ascribed to this quality in French royalty.
But almost all the bishop-princes of Geneva who preceded
the Reformation, cared little for the development
of the nation, except it were to thwart it. John
of Savoy and Pierre de la Baume were nothing
but selfish dissolute priests. No halo was seen on
their brows; and thus they found one day that there
was no firm ground under their feet. Ecclesiastical
authorities, even when honest, are apt to despise the
temporal interests of their subjects; and as unhappily
spiritual interests do not much affect ambitious prelates,
the immortal souls and the earthly liberties of
their flocks are equally oppressed by them.</p>

<p>The duke, who knew better than anybody the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
weakness of the episcopal power (which he had mainly
caused), felt his ambition increase, and resolved to
put an end to it. With this intent he would take a
step which, by giving him what Savoy had coveted
for centuries, would fortify him with a title calculated
to impose silence on the complaints of the prelate,
the accusations of the fugitives, and the demands
of the Swiss. He determined to convene a general
council, composed almost exclusively of his creatures,
from which he would obtain, either by persuasion or
by a great display of force, the homage due to a
sovereign. To attain his object he began by toning
down his insolent conduct and his unjust pretensions.
Treasurer Boulet, first cause of all these disturbances,
being obliged to furnish his accounts at the h&ocirc;tel-de-ville,
was condemned. The citizens imprisoned or
fined received the promise of an early amnesty; and
imagining he had thus gained every heart, Charles
desired the people to be called together, that all the
community might know of the good-will he entertained
towards them. The syndics and the bishop’s vicar,
perceiving that the fatal hour had arrived, refused his
demand. They were not strong, but fear came upon
them in that solemn moment when they saw Geneva
suspended over the abyss. Gruet, the vicar, stammered
out some excuses: ‘Nobody would come to
the council,’ he said, ‘but rabble and ruffians.’ It
was precisely what the duke wanted. Being already
master of Geneva and claiming to make everything
bend under his absolute will, he would not allow Gruet
to finish his speech: ‘It is my council’s advice,’ he
said, ‘that the people should assemble to-morrow,
Sunday, at eight in the forenoon, in the cloister of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
St. Pierre. Have this published by sound of trumpet,
and let the heads of families be informed by sending
from door to door.’ Then turning to the vicar, he
added: ‘You will be present with all the episcopal
council.’ He informed them that he would visit the
assembly on his way to mass, and would then tell
them his pleasure; so that the council might prepare
their answer during service-time, and he would receive
it on his way back. The ducal partisans ran from
street to street and from house to house in order to
muster all their forces at an assembly called in the
name of a prince whose subjects lived at Chamb&eacute;ry
and Turin.<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">384</a> The liberals, who were still numerous
in Geneva, pretty generally kept away: they did not
consider a council assembled by the duke to be legitimate.</p>

<p>The next day, Sunday, December 10, the great bell
of the cathedral having summoned the citizens, men
whose names are for the most part unknown appeared
to form a council. The most important portion in
this <i>popular</i> assembly was not the people, but the
duke, who appeared between nine and ten o’clock,
accompanied by the Bishop of Maurienne, the episcopal
council, the chancellor of Savoy, and his chamberlains,
esquires, officers, and many gentlemen from his
states; before and behind came the archers of Savoy.
Carrying their halberds with a threatening air, and
impatient to reduce this herd of shopkeepers under
their prince, these mercenaries gave the meeting the
appearance of a battle-field rather than of a council.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
Nothing like it had ever been witnessed in the city.
Resolved that day to make the conquest of Geneva,
Charles proudly mounted to the place reserved for
the sovereign; his courtiers drew up to the right and
left, and his soldiers formed in a circle round the
assembly, while above their heads flashed the broad-pointed
bills at the end of the long staves, as if to
frighten the citizens. The duke reclining upon the
throne, which was covered with rich tapestry, ordered
his chancellor to explain his sovereign intentions. The
latter, making a low bow, read: ‘About three months
ago, as the duke was preparing to cross the mountains
on Italian business, he learnt that certain seditious
people, who have fled to the country of the League,
were sowing dissension between him and the bishop,
between Geneva and the Swiss.... Whereupon his
Highness, who has always been a mild and gentle
prince to this city, seeing it threatened by a frightful
calamity, neglected his own interests, hastened to you,
and has spared neither money nor pains to restore
peace among you. In return for so many benefits,
this magnanimous prince asks but one thing ... that
you should recognise him as your sovereign protector.’
The protection was evidently a mere veil to hide
dominion and despotism; accordingly the few honest
citizens there present were dispirited and silent. It
was necessary to make haste, for the duke wished to
avert all opposition. Having read the paper, the
chancellor stepped forward, and cried as loud as he
could, for his voice was weak: ‘Are you willing to
live in obedience to your bishop and prince, and under
the protection of my lord duke?’ ... The question
should now have been put to the vote; but the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
impatient mamelukes carried it by acclamation, shouting
out with all their might: ‘Yes, yes!’ The chancellor
resumed: ‘My lord, seeing the great love this
city feels towards him, cancels all the penalties it has
incurred, takes off all sequestrations, remits all fines,
which amount to twenty-two thousand crowns, and
pardons all rebels&mdash;those excepted who have fled to
Switzerland.’ Such are usually the amnesties of tyrants;
those are excepted who ought to be included,
and those included who do not need it. ‘Thanks,
thanks!’ replied the mamelukes. ‘As my chancellor
may not have been distinctly heard,’ said Charles to
Syndic Montyon, ‘have the goodness to repeat what
he has said in my name.’ After this, his Highness,
with his chancellor, courtiers, gentlemen, and halberdiers,
left the assembly and went to mass. It looked
like a triumphal procession. As for those left behind,
if there were venal citizens who dared to raise their
heads, there were others whose uneasy consciences
bowed them down.<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">385</a></p>

<p>As soon as the Genevese were left to themselves,
Montyon, a fanatical partisan of Savoy, got on a bench
and repeated, not without embarrassment, the chancellor’s
address. The halberdiers being away, the assent
was no longer unanimous. There were still many
honest men in Geneva who clung to the ancient institutions
of the State and held a Savoyard usurpation in
horror. Some, at the very moment when the liberty
of their country was about to be thrown into the abyss,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
were smitten with a last love for her. ‘The address
is full of guile,’ they said. Many, however, acceded to
the ‘protection,’ but added, ‘saving the authority of
the prince-bishop and the liberties of the city,’ which
nullified the vote.<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">386</a></p>

<p>Such was the <i>Council of Halberds</i>. It had given
Geneva the Duke of Savoy for her <i>protector</i>, and had
imposed on the citizens <i>obedience</i> towards that prince.
An encroaching, powerful, able court, like that of Turin,
could easily make an hereditary sovereignty out
of such a concession. But a course of violence and
stratagem provokes the resistance of noble minds.
After the action of despotism, the reaction of liberty
was to begin; the bow too violently bent by the duke
was to break in his hand.</p>

<p>The next day, in fact, Charles, who fancied himself
already prince of the city, wishing to enter upon his
new career, requested the city to hand over to him the
jurisdiction in criminal matters, which was refused.
Nor was this the only check; the procurator-fiscal
having, by his Highness’s orders, sent from house to
house to collect votes against the alliance with the Swiss,
many flatly refused to give them. At this moment the
duke appeared as if he were stunned. He had matters
on his mind which troubled and disturbed him; they
made him mistrustful and anxious. The assembled
people had just taken the oath of obedience to him ...
and to his first two requests (such legitimate requests
as he thought them) they had replied by a No!
After having given an example of his extreme violence,
Charles gave another of his extreme weakness.
He thought Geneva crushed; but Geneva, even when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
crushed, alarmed him. He pressed his foot upon her
neck, but he felt the corpse moving under him.
Even the mamelukes he began to consider as obstinate
republicans, secretly defending their independence.
His head began to reel, his heart to fail him. The essential
trait of his character, it will be remembered, was
to begin everything and finish nothing. This union of
violence and folly, of which several Roman emperors
have furnished examples, was found also in Charles.
At the moment he had gained an important victory,
and just as it was necessary for him to remain on the
field of battle to profit by it, he turned his back and
fled precipitately into Piedmont. It was asserted
that Beatrice had recalled him. ‘Venus overcame
Pallas,’ says Bonivard. The prior of St. Victor is
always inclined to be sarcastic. But if (as is possible)
it was the desire to join the duchess which
induced Charles III. to let that city of Geneva
slip from his hands, which the house of Savoy had
coveted for ages, it is a proof that if he was violent
enough to take it, he was too weak to keep it. However
that may be, on the 12th of December, 1525, the
duke quitted the city, and from that day neither he
nor his successors entered it again. If Charles had
remained, and followed the advice of his ministers,
he would probably have established his authority, and
bound Geneva to Rome. The triumph of the power
of Savoy at the extremity of Lake Leman would have
had serious consequences. But the victory he was
about to win&mdash;which he had even gained ... was lost
by his cowardly desertion, and lost for ever.<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">387</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span></p>

<p>So did not think the syndic Montyon and fifty of
the most servile mamelukes. Proud of the decision of
the Council of Halberds, they resolved to make it
known to the Swiss. The horseman intrusted with
the message departed, and, on his arrival at Friburg,
delivered the letters to the avoyer. ‘The fugitives
are deceiving you,’ said the writers; ‘the entire community
desires to live under the protection of our
most dread lord the Duke of Savoy.’ This accusation
revived all the energy of the huguenots. The mamelukes
charged them with lying.... From that hour they
feared neither the dungeon nor the sword. Imprison
them in C&aelig;sar’s tower, in the castle of Bonne, or elsewhere,
it matters not: they are ready to expose themselves
to the violence of the enemy. ‘Appoint a commissioner,’
said some of them; ‘let him come with us
to Geneva, and he will tell you which of the two has
lied, we or the mamelukes.’ John Lullin and two or
three of his friends departed without a safe-conduct,
accompanied by De Sergine, a Friburg notary, resolved
to prove that Geneva desired to be free. The unexpected
news of Lullin’s arrival spread through the
city; numbers of citizens immediately crowded round
the bold and imprudent huguenot, gazed upon him
with tenderness, and anxiously asked for news of the
exiles. Fathers, brothers, sons, friends came in great
anxiety of mind to hear the tidings of those they loved
dearest. ‘Alas!’ said Lullin, ‘how can I tell of their
misery and sorrow?’ ... He described them as exiled,
oppressed with fears for their country, despised by
some, ill-treated by others, destitute, ‘reduced to
Job’s dunghill,’ obliged in order to support their families
to receive alms from such strangers as had compassion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
on their wretchedness. But here the generous
huguenot, whose wounded heart was bursting with
tears and full of bitterness, could contain himself no
longer: ‘It is you,’ he exclaimed, ‘it is you that increase
our sorrow&mdash;yes, you!’ He indignantly complained
that the Genevans remaining in Geneva disavowed
those who had left it to save her independence,
and made them pass for liars. He asked them how it
was that, as the foreign prince had fled beyond the Alps,
Geneva did not reclaim the liberty which he had taken
away. ‘Is it thus that citizens defend the ancient
rights handed down by their fathers?’ This touching
language, the presence of him who uttered it and of
the two or three fugitives at his side, the sight of their
poverty, their distress, their patriotism, and their
heroic courage, stirred the citizens. The Savoyard
agents, Balleyson, Saleneuve, and their soldiers, remained
in the city to no purpose: Geneva awoke
from her slumbers. ‘Friburg desires to know the
real state of this city?’ said a few patriots to Sergine;
‘come, then, with us to the council&mdash;come and see
for yourself.’ The most energetic men were still in
Switzerland; but by degrees all in Geneva who loved
liberty were seen to shake off the silence to which
they had been reduced. They encouraged one another
to make an imposing demonstration. Erelong the
justification of the <i>foreigners</i> took place, and it was
conducted with all the solemnity that a simple people
could give it.<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">388</a>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.<br />

<span class="small">THE PEOPLE AND THE BISHOP DEFEND THE CAUSE OF THE
FUGITIVES.<br />

(<span class="smcap">December 1525 To February 1526.</span>)</span></h2>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">On</span> the 22nd of December, ten days after Charles’s
departure, crowds of citizens poured from every
quarter towards the h&ocirc;tel-de-ville. The syndics and
the council, who were then sitting, were informed that
certain persons desired to be admitted; the doors were
opened, and the petitioners entered. At their head
walked John Bandi&egrave;re, a man about sixty years old,
whose son Ami (syndic in the Reformation year)
was among the fugitives. This venerable man advanced,
surrounded by the children of his son and of
other exiles.<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">389</a> With him came several citizens who,
though they had remained in the background during
recent events, might yet with good right appear in
the front line. There was the amiable Ami Porral,
afterwards syndic, who zealously embraced the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
evangelical faith; Pierre de Joye, cousin of that De
Joye whom Bishop John had desired to put to death;
the bold Robert Vandel, syndic in 1529, his brother
Peter, Sept, De Chapeaurouge, Falquet, Lect, Delapalud,
Malbuisson, Favre, Lullin, Denis Hugues, son
of the estimable Besan&ccedil;on: in short, says a document
of the time, about 100 citizens, the flower of Geneva.
These men desired not only to bear testimony in favour
of men unjustly accused; but observing that those to
whom the reins of the State had been confided were
slumbering, that the chariot was leaving the track and
about to fall into the ditch, they thought it their duty
to set the drivers on the right road. Bandi&egrave;re, his
face wet with tears (says a manuscript), spoke first:
‘Most honourable lords,’ he said, ‘you see these children;
do you not know their fathers? Are not these
poor little ones orphans already, though their fathers
are still alive?’<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">390</a>&mdash;‘Yes,’ exclaimed the councillors.&mdash;‘Those
citizens,’ continued Bandi&egrave;re, ‘who, for having
defended the liberties of Geneva, were compelled,
through a thousand dangers, to seek refuge in Germany
yonder,<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">391</a>&mdash;are not they good men?’ ... ‘They
are,’ was the answer. ‘Are they not citizens of this
city&mdash;the good men whose fathers, sons, and connections
you have before you?’&mdash;It was cheerfully
acknowledged.</p>

<p>Having thus the testimony of the council in favour
of the refugees&mdash;a testimony of which the Friburg
deputy made a note&mdash;the venerable Bandi&egrave;re continued:
‘These refugees, whom you acknowledge to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
be good men, are surprised that you should have disavowed
them in letters sent to the League. For this
reason, we who are here present declare boldly that
we approve them, both in their words and in their acts,
and count them to be faithful and devoted citizens.
At the same time, most honourable lords, we protest
against every encroachment attempted by a foreign
power on the rights of our prince and the liberties of
the city.’</p>

<p>Thus the slumbering Geneva, whom Charles had
thought dead, cast off the bonds with which that
prince had bound her, and, rejecting the duke with
one hand, called the fugitives back with the other.
Bandi&egrave;re handed in his declaration in writing, and
demanded letters-testimonial. Syndic Montyon, in
great embarrassment, said that it was necessary to
deliberate before answering. ‘Where is the necessity?’
exclaimed the energetic Robert Vandel.&mdash;‘It is not
the custom to give testimonials here,’ was the reply.
The huguenot, astonished at this refusal of a simple
receipt, grew impatient, and, turning towards De Sergine,
desired him to draw up the act himself.</p>

<p>The syndics and councillors had not yet remarked
this person. ‘Not imagining they had such a visitor
in their house,’ says Bonivard, ‘they looked at him
with astonishment.’ Their astonishment increased
when they saw the Friburger rise and say, addressing
the whole assembly: ‘Sirs, do you acknowledge those
who are in the country of the Helvetians to be men
worthy of all honour; and do you ratify all that may
be done by them for the welfare of this illustrious
city?’ The syndics and councillors, surprised at this
extraordinary question, kept silent; but all the other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
citizens present, voting as if in general council, answered
‘Yes!’ De Sergine, calling the council to
witness the complete approval that had been given
the fugitives, withdrew, followed by the hundred citizens,
proud of having made the voice of the people
heard in the very bosom of an enslaved senate.<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">392</a></p>

<p>De Sergine, unwilling to lose a moment, sat down
without ceremony on the steps of the h&ocirc;tel-de-ville,
as might have been done, perhaps, in the simple republics
of antiquity, and prepared to draw up the
letters-testimonial that were required of him. A certain
number of patriots stood around him; others went
through the city reporting what had just taken place.
Men rejoiced everywhere; they directed their steps
towards the h&ocirc;tel-de-ville, remembering that God
never forsakes a people that does not forsake itself.
Every minute fresh citizens came and increased the
strange assembly gathered round the notary, and
every new-comer was eager to have his name at the
foot of the declaration. All were speaking and arguing
at once; some wept, others laughed; they felt
that a new breath was passing over the city, and that
its ancient liberties were recovering their vitality.
All voices united in proclaiming the praises of the
fugitives. ‘Yes, certainly they are better than us,’
said the crowd, ‘for they have forsaken everything
that our liberties might be preserved.’ For a long
time no such enthusiasm and joy had been witnessed
in Geneva; and comparisons were drawn between this
noble assembly, where every one gave his name at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>
peril of his life, and that gloomy Council of the Halberds,
held in the duke’s presence: on one side pomp
and tyranny; on the other, simplicity and liberty.
Forsaken by the bishop, threatened by the duke,
watched by the Count of Genevois, surrounded by
the armed soldiers of Saleneuve and Balleyson, ever
prompt to acts of violence, the citizens followed each
other, from noon until five o’clock, to sign the document
which was to secure their alliance with Switzerland
and the triumph of their liberties.</p>

<p>The mamelukes, however, wishing to stop a movement
which threatened to rob the duke of all his recent
advantages, had recourse to secret practices. Creeping
up to some of the patriots of their acquaintance whom
they saw approaching, they would say: ‘Beware!
when the duke returns with his army, he will lay his
hand on these testimonials, he will count the names,
he will mark the most guilty with a cross, and send
them to rejoin the shades of Berthelier and L&eacute;vrier.’
The duke had, in truth, his revenge in reserve; but the
citizens heeded it not, and replied to this manœuvre by
giving in their names with greater enthusiasm. The
approach of the festivals of Christmas and of the New
Year compelled many to stay in their shops, who were
thus prevented from signing; to provide against which,
men went from house to house, asking who would vote
for the alliance with Switzerland. There were not a
hundred persons in Geneva who refused. The protest
of the h&ocirc;tel-de-ville decided the fate of the city. Many
of the first subscribers were in the number of those
who received the Gospel most gladly. The dawn of
the emancipation which was then beginning to appear,
was to be followed by the full light of the Reformation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span>
But before that glorious day arrived, what struggles,
what wars, what dangers, Geneva would still have to
go through!<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">393</a></p>

<p>Erelong the movement descended, spreading from
the h&ocirc;tel-de-ville through all the streets of the city;
and to the noble protest of the principal citizens were
added the rejoicings of the young folks and of the
people. The holidays of Christmas and of the New
Year had arrived. The ‘children of Geneva,’ masked
or with blackened faces, paraded the streets to the
sound of the drum, singing and shouting all over the
city: ‘Long live the huguenots!’ During this time
the citizens held frequent meetings both by day and
by night, at which they boldly called for the return of
the patriots, though they saw the dangers that would
accompany them. Some of the independents visited
Switzerland by stealth, to report all that had taken
place and bring back the fugitives in triumph.</p>

<p>The Savoyard party, who still had the power in
their hands, were firmly resolved not to give it up.
The episcopal council sat all night. The syndics,
the vicar, and the vidame in particular, were losing
their heads. To prevent the movement from succeeding,
they took useless and contradictory steps,
calculated rather to increase the irritation in men’s
minds: nothing prospered with them. ‘Fancy how
surprised they are,’ wrote the worthy Porral to
Hugues. ‘They will go mad, please God. The
vidame is always indoors with the gout; may God
keep him there! They have forbidden the boatmen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>
to ferry anybody over the water at night.... They
are afraid that God will give them what they deserve.’
The procurator-fiscal issued writs against all who had
signed the protest. ‘If you will not answer according
to my pleasure,’ he said to them, ‘I will force you
to speak.’&mdash;‘Really,’ said Porral, who already felt the
need of another liberty than political liberty, ‘really,
I think that after they have compelled us to deny our
parents, neighbours, and friends, they will constrain
us next to deny God himself.’</p>

<p>Yet, if the party of Savoy appeared ‘sick,’ that of
liberty was still very weak. Both portions of the
community turned at the same time towards the
bishop. ‘His authority is in question,’ said certain
patriots; ‘he will side with us against Savoy. Let
us summon him.’&mdash;‘The bishop cannot side with
rebels,’ said the episcopal council and the mamelukes;
‘let us hasten his return.’ As the prelate was still
beyond the Alps, the two parties wrote to him, each
for itself: ‘Return speedily; without you we can do
nothing.’<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">394</a></p>

<p>This was embarrassing to Pierre de la Baume. On
the one hand, he clung to his principality, and at certain
moments he would have withstood the duke; but
on the other hand, he felt himself unable to resist
that prince, and thus he fluctuated perpetually between
duty and fear. He started for Geneva, not
knowing what he would do there.</p>

<p>On Thursday, February 1, 1526, one hundred
and sixty mounted citizens rode out of the city to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span>
meet the prelate: ‘Why, they are all huguenots,’ said
Biolley, an ardent mameluke and secretary to the
council, as he saw them pass. There was however
something else. On each side of the bishop rode
Saleneuve and Balleyson, both devoted servants of
the duke, and Charles, distrusting La Baume, expected
that he would obey them as if they were his
guardians. The prelate loved neither his Highness nor
the citizens of Geneva, ‘but only to fill his purse, that
he might empty it afterwards in playing <i>gaudeamus</i>,’
says a contemporary. The two chamberlains, however,
kept so close to him that he could not speak
freely to anybody. He behaved politely towards
them, and seemed to be their very humble servant;
but as soon as he arrived at the bridge of Arve, where
Savoy ended and the Genevese territory began, the
bishop spurred his horse, and rode in front of his
‘guardians,’ as a sign that he was lord and master.
Then assuming his right position, he obliged them
from that moment to speak to him uncovered.<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">395</a></p>

<p>The Savoyard nobles were determined, however,
not to lose their prey. The next day (February 2),
after dinner, as the two guardians were keeping the
bishop ‘at a gaming-table,’ it was whispered him
that Robert Vandel wanted him. Vandel, one of
the Genevese liberals, possessed all his confidence,
and the bishop desired much to see him; but Saleneuve
and Balleyson continued their game, and Pierre
de la Baume knew not what to do to escape them.
Unable to hold out any longer, he rose, alleging some
very natural pretext, and hastened to a little room
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span>
at the back of the house, where Vandel was. ‘Well,
Robert,’ said the prelate rather sharply, ‘they tell me
that you have made a declaration in the city contrary
to my authority.’&mdash;‘You have been deceived,’ replied
Vandel, who read him the protest of the h&ocirc;tel-de-ville.
‘Well, well,’ said the prelate, ‘there is no
great harm in that.’ Vandel then represented to him
that if Geneva owed a double obedience, one to the
duke, another to the bishop, as the Council of Halberds
had determined, the first would certainly
swallow up the second. Pierre de la Baume had no
doubt of it.&mdash;‘There is somebody,’ he said, lowering
his voice, ‘very glad of my coming, but he will be
vexed afterwards.... I will not lose an inch of my
jurisdiction, were I to spend all my property in defending
it. I will have no alliance with the Swiss,
however; this I promised the duke.’ Vandel represented
to him that the Genevans sought this alliance
only to protect the episcopal sovereignty against the
usurpations of Savoy; and then, knowing the prelate’s
avarice, he added shrewdly: ‘When the alliance with
the Swiss is concluded, we will proceed against the
duke’s creatures, we will confiscate their property,
and, my lord ... that will do you no harm.’&mdash;‘What
are you saying, Robert?’ Vandel explained his
meaning more fully. Such language moved the bishop
to turn round.&mdash;‘Really,’ he answered. ‘Well, we
will talk more fully about it another time; for the
moment, farewell.’ The converted prelate went back
to his two keepers.<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">396</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span></p>

<p>The bishop, won over by Vandel, made many reflections
during the night, and the next day he desired
to see the syndics and the council, who had greatly
irritated him by their concessions to the duke. ‘Tell
me how you have been going on since my departure,’
he said mildly, and then continued sharply: ‘You
asked me to join in your appeal to Rome, and then
you withdrew from it without my consent.... This is
bad; you should have done your duty without fear,
whatever wrong might be done you.... I will not
give up the appeal; I would rather convene the people....
God and the world shall be satisfied with me.’
La Baume had seen the duke in Piedmont. ‘His
Highness,’ said he, turning towards his episcopal
council, ‘told me that he meant to have the sovereignty
of Geneva, and asked me for a day to come
to an understanding about it; but I answered immediately
that although Pierre de la Baume is his
humble subject, his Highness has no business in my
city.... I am determined to maintain the rights of my
church and the liberties of my city&mdash;until death.’
Then turning again to the syndics: ‘As for those who
have retired into Switzerland,’ he said, ‘I hold them
to be honest people, and, saving the alliance, I approve
of all they may do.’</p>

<p>On a sudden the bishop asked himself what he
should say to the duke if such language was reported
to him.... Startled at his own courage, he became
confused, hesitated, and, speaking low to the first
syndic, he said: ‘I wish you did as they do at Venice.
Your council is not secret; it ought to be so. Understand
clearly that I embrace the city party; but the
benefices I possess in his Highness’s states compel me
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>
to do so secretly.... If in any circumstance I seem
opposed to your interests, remember that it is in appearance
only.’ At the same time, the bishop wrote and
told the fugitives of his intention to pay all the expenses
which the independence of the city necessitated;
but he added: ‘If I write you the contrary, pay no
attention to it; I shall do so only through fear of the
duke, and not to make him angry.’ The spirit of his
policy was deception. Such was the last bishop of
Geneva.<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">397</a></p>

<p>The annual nomination of the syndics was about
to take place, and the city was in great commotion.
Both parties counted on this election: the mamelukes
to establish the duke in Geneva, and the huguenots to
expel him. The great patriots were in exile; victory
seemed assured to the ducals. Yet the timidest even
of the huguenots took courage, and swore to elect
‘honest men who would secure the liberty of the city.’
The general council having assembled on the 4th of
February, 1526, the mameluke syndic Montyon proposed
eight candidates, from whom, according to the
order prescribed by the duke, they must elect four
syndics. Then Robert Vandel stood up: ‘I am authorised
by the citizens,’ he said to Montyon, ‘to inform
you that they will not be muzzled (<i>brigidari</i>).’
Then, turning to the people, he asked: ‘Is it not true?’
All replied: ‘Yes, yes!’ many at the same time calling
out ‘Jean Philippe.’ Philippe was not only not
one of the eight, but he was one of the exiles. ‘We
will make Jean Philippe syndic,’ repeated the huguenots,
‘and thus show that he and the others in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span>
Switzerland are good citizens.’ If Besan&ccedil;on Hugues
was not the popular choice, it was probably because
the people were still angry with that noble exile for
his refusal in the preceding year.</p>

<p>At this moment the bishop’s procurator-fiscal Mandalla
appeared. La Baume’s courage was not heroic;
he trembled at the idea of a purely huguenot election,
and desired to get a moderate list&mdash;half servile, half
liberal&mdash;passed. In his name, Mandalla proposed
four candidates, among whom was the traitor Cartelier.
‘That will quiet all angry feelings,’ said the procurator.
It was not a clever manœuvre, for Cartelier’s
name was sufficient to discredit the others.</p>

<p>The polling began. Each man went up to the secretary
and gave in his vote. The most energetic of the
two parties counted the votes received. The procurator-fiscal
watched the election with anxiety. Soon,
vexed and dispirited, he ran and told the bishop that
the people took no account of his message.... Pierre
de la Baume was frightened. The zealous fiscal ran
again to the polling-place: ‘My lord conjures you,’
he said, ‘at least not to elect Jean Philippe, considering
that he is not in the city.’&mdash;‘We will make no
choice that will be disagreeable to the bishop,’ they
answered politely, and at the same time continued
giving their votes to the exile. The people of Geneva
were determined to show, in a striking manner, that
they were breaking with Savoy and uniting with Switzerland,
and treading boldly in the path of liberty.
The bishop, still more alarmed, finding that his procurator
obtained nothing, sent his vicar to protest, in
his name, against so dangerous an election. ‘It shall
be done as our prince pleases,’ said they courteously;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span>
and then, ‘without noise or murmur, were elected
four huguenots. Sire Jean Philippe (they said in the
city) received more votes than any of the others.’
The citizens cared no more for the bishop than for the
duke, when the reestablishment of their liberties was
concerned. The people had never been more united;
the opposition counted only eleven, and after the election
everybody declared that they sided with the
majority. They said one to another that a free and
courageous people, if God comes to their aid, can never
perish.</p>

<p>Confusion was in the bishop’s palace. As soon as
opposition is made to the duke, said some, revolution
breaks its bounds ... this election must be annulled.
The bishop ordered that another general council
should be held on the morrow, and, calculating on
his personal influence, he appeared at it, attended by
his councillors and officers; but the people were deaf,
and confirmed Philippe’s election; only they appointed
his brother-in-law (D. Franc) to take his place during
his absence. Not satisfied with this, the people repealed
all statutes contrary to the liberties of Geneva
passed under fear of Charles of Savoy. The bishop,
alarmed at these republican proceedings, exclaimed:
‘Is there nobody that wishes to maintain these ordinances?’
No one answered. Everything fell, and
the ancient constitution was restored. After having
changed the laws, they set about changing the persons.
They would have no partisans of Savoy to preserve
the liberties of Geneva. Huguenot councillors were
elected in the place of mamelukes. The restoration of
Genevese liberties had been so promptly accomplished
that the ducal faction could not believe their eyes.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span>
‘Our <i>brewers</i> were never more astounded,’ said the
huguenots. (The <i>brewers</i> were the men who <i>brewed</i>
or plotted treason.) There were men in the ducal
party who changed their opinions as the wind changes;
they were now seen accosting the patriots and shaking
hands with them.... ‘See,’ said the huguenots, ‘how
well they counterfeit the air of good fellowship!’ ...
Then all true friends of their country exclaimed:
‘Let us praise God! <i>Laus Deo!</i>’<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">398</a></p>

<p>Thus did liberty triumph. The Genevese people had
restored their franchises, dismissed the mamelukes,
rejected the cruel protectorate of Charles III., sought
the alliance of Switzerland; and after all that, they
gave God the glory.<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">399</a></p>

<p>As the cause of Savoy was lost, the bishop, so long
wavering, made a show of placing himself on the side of
the free and the bold. He sent Pierre Bertholo to carry
this important news to Jean Philippe and all those
exiles of whom he was so afraid. The latter had not
lost their time; they endeavoured to enlighten the
Swiss, and Hugues continually argued and repeated
that Geneva was not under subjection to the duke.
At this time Bertholo arrived. ‘The ordinances of
Savoy are repealed,’ he told the refugees; ‘patriots
replace the serviles everywhere, and one of you has
been elected syndic&mdash;Jean Philippe!’ They could
hardly believe this news. What! one of these wretched
fugitives, of these <i>mendicants</i> (as their enemies called
them), raised by the people of Geneva to the head of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>
State!... What a refutation of the ducal calumnies!
But the ‘foreigners’ did not forget themselves in
the joy which this message caused them. Taking
Bertholo with them, they proceeded to the Bernese
council, and reported the unexpected intelligence
brought by the messenger. ‘Up to the present time,’
said the avoyer, ‘I have invited Besan&ccedil;on Hugues
alone, as your chief, to sit down at my side; now,
Messire Jean Philippe, take your seat above Besan&ccedil;on,
as syndic of Geneva.’ The alliance would no longer
meet with obstacles. ‘We accept you as fellow-freemen,’
continued the avoyer, ‘without heed to those
growlers and their threats, which do not last long
now-a-days.’<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">400</a></p>

<p>The people of Geneva were about to rise, if we may
so speak, from the grave. They had acted with decision,
with energy, with unwavering firmness. They
desired to have for their magistrates none but men
able to maintain their laws and independence, and
had boldly erased from the code of the republic all
ordinances contrary to the liberties of Geneva. Accordingly,
‘a person of mark,’ who lived at the beginning
of the seventeenth century, exclaimed, after
studying these facts: ‘This history is a marvellous one,
and calls to my mind a tract in the <i>Philetes</i> of Plato,
touching the moral good comprised in the three ideas:
<i>Reality</i>, <i>Proportion</i>, and <i>Truth</i>. It is full of the
special marks of the wise and merciful providence
of God, who has guided, up to this present hour, this
<i>ship of his miracles</i> through an infinity of shoals.
The more thoroughly we contemplate human action,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span>
so much the deeper appear the counsels of God.’<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">401</a>
What we are about to see appears to confirm these
words.

(<span class="smcap">February To August 1526.</span>)</span></h2>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Then</span> a step was taken without which the Reformation
would never have been established in
Geneva. In the morning of the 20th of February
the representatives of Berne, Friburg, and Geneva
resolved to conclude solemnly the alliance between
the three cities, for which the people had sighed
during so many years. They met, they gave their
hands, affection and confidence were in every feature.
‘In the name of the most holy and most high Trinity,’
said the three free states, ‘in the name of God the
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, we reciprocally promise
mutual friendship and intercourse in order that
we may be able to preserve the good that God has
given us in justice, repose, and true peace.... And if
hereafter one or many should wish to molest the
syndics, councils, or freemen of the city of Geneva
in their persons, honour, goods, or estate, we, the
avoyers, councils, and freemen of the cities of Berne
and Friburg&mdash;by virtue of our oath made and sworn&mdash;are
bound to give the said city favour, aid, and
succour, and to march out our armies ... at their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>
charge, however.’<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">402</a> The required formalities having
been fulfilled: ‘Gentlemen,’ said Jean Philippe, ‘we
will depart and carry this good news ourselves to our
country.’ The councils of Berne and Friburg ordered
that a number of deputies from each canton equal to
that of the fugitives should accompany them, with
power to seal the alliance at Geneva. All the exiles
left on the same day; but how different was the
return from that breathless flight which had not long
ago brought them to Friburg! ‘They went, not in
fear and dread as they had come, but taking the
high road through the Pays de Vaud, where all
strove to do them honour; for,’ says Bonivard, ‘they
still smelt the reek of the roast meat of Morat.’</p>

<p>On the 23rd of February the news of the speedy
arrival of the exiles and delegates of the cantons
spread through Geneva; citizen told it to citizen,
great was the joy, and arrangements were made for
their reception. The syndics on horseback, carrying
their batons, followed by all who had horses, went
out to meet them, and the people collected near the
Swiss gate to receive them. A salute of guns announced
their approach. They walked three abreast:
in the middle was a Genevan fugitive, on his right
and left a deputy of Berne and of Friburg: this order,
continued through the whole line, announced more
clearly than all the rest the close union of the three
cities. Geneva, allied to the Swiss, might be able
to preserve its independence; Geneva was saved. A
conversion had been wrought in its people. Hitherto
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span>
they had turned to the south; now they turned towards
the north: they began to cast off Rome and to
catch a glimpse of Wittemberg. There are certain
movements in nations that transform their destinies.
The citizens could not take their eyes off those
unhappy men who had had such difficulty in escaping
the archers of Savoy, and who, strange to say,
were returning holding Berne and Friburg by the
hand. They had gone away, still disposed to appeal
to Rome; but having heard much talk in Switzerland
of the Reformation, they were to be the first to welcome
Farel and the Gospel to Geneva.... Relations and
friends pressed in their arms these fugitives, whom
they had thought they should never see again. ‘They
were sumptuously entertained at the h&ocirc;tel-de-ville. A
<i>morality on the said alliance</i> was performed, and a
bonfire was lighted on the Place Molard.’<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">403</a> The
Council of Two Hundred was convened.</p>

<p>This important council assembled, but instead of
two hundred citizens, three hundred and twenty met
together. This sitting was to be a festival; everybody
desired to be present. It was known that
Hugues would speak: the respect they felt for the
great citizen and his companions in misfortune, the
adventures he had to relate, mixed up (it was reported)
with strange facts, excited interest and curiosity.
Hugues rose to speak: there was deep silence:
‘You know, sirs,’ he began, ‘that five or six months
ago, on the morrow of Holy Cross (September 15,
1525), we left here in great haste by different roads;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span>
without communicating with one another, not knowing
where to go to escape the rage of the most illustrious
duke, Monseigneur of Savoy. We were warned by
friends that, on the demand of certain persons in this
city, the prince was resolved to take us and put us
ignominiously to death, because we had resisted innovations
opposed to our liberties. Ah! sirs, that was no
child’s play, believe me. The archers and agents of
my lord of Savoy pursued us as far as St. Claude, from
St. Claude to Besan&ccedil;on, and beyond.... We had to
travel day and night in the woods, through wind and
rain, not knowing where to go in quest of safety....
At last we considered that we had friends at Friburg,
and thither we went.’</p>

<p>The citizens, riveting their eyes on Hugues, did
not lose a word of his narrative and of the details
which he added. They seemed to bear him company
through those woods and mountains, among the
ravines and snow; they fancied they heard behind
them the tramp of the armed men in pursuit of
them.... What struck them was not only the epic
element in the flight and return of these free men, of
which ancient Greece would doubtless have made
one of the finest myths in her history; it was in an
especial manner the sovereign importance which these
acts had for them. During those sacred days, Geneva
and her destinies had turned on their axis; her gates
were opened on the side of light and liberty; the
flight, the residence at Berne and Friburg, and the
return of Hugues and his companions, are one of the
most important pages in the annals of the city.</p>

<p>Hugues continued: he told them how Friburg and
Berne had seen no other means of securing their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span>
liberties than by receiving them into their alliance....
‘Here are the letters duly sealed with their great
seals,’ said the noble orator, presenting a parchment.
‘They are written in German; but I will tell you
their substance, article by article, without deceiving
you in any&mdash;on my life.’ He read the act of alliance,
and added: ‘Sirs, my comrades and I here present
promise you, on our lives and goods, that the said
citizenship is such. Consider, sirs, if you will ratify
and accept it.’ The assembly testified its approbation
with thanks to God, and resolved to convoke a general
council for the next day.<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">404</a></p>

<p>The catholic party and the ducal party were
aroused. The Swiss alliance, an immense innovation,
threatened all the conquests they had made with so
much trouble in Geneva during so many generations.
The bishop, full of uneasiness, consulted with the canons
and some others on whom he thought he could
rely. All told him that if Berne had its way in
Geneva, there would be no more bishop, no more
prince. To work then! All the powers of feudalism
and the papacy conspired against an alliance which first
gave Geneva liberty and afterwards the Gospel. At
first they wished to prevent the general council from
meeting. It was customary to summon it by tolling
the great bell; now Canon Lutry had the key of the
tower where this bell hung. In the evening the
reverend father, followed by some armed men, climbed
step by step up the narrow stairs which led to the
bell-loft, and placed the men in garrison there. ‘You
are here,’ he said, ‘to defend the bell and not to give
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span>
it up;’ he then went down, double-locked the door,
and carried away the key. In the morning the door
was found to be locked, and Lutry refused to open it.
‘The canons,’ it was said in the city, ‘are opposed to
the assembling of the people.’ The irritated citizens
ran together. ‘Whereupon there was a great uproar
and alarm in the church of St. Pierre, so that De
Lutry was constrained to open the door and give up
the bell.’<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">405</a></p>

<p>It was all over; they resolved still to fight a last
battle, even with the certainty of being defeated. The
general council met; the bishop went thither in person,
attended by his episcopal followers, in the hope
that his presence might intimidate the huguenots. ‘I
am head, pastor, and prince of the community,’ he
said. ‘It concerns my affairs, and I wish to know
what will be laid before you.’&mdash;‘It is not the custom
for my lord to be present,’ said Hugues; ‘the citizens
transact none but political matters here<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">406</a> which concern
them wholly. His presence, however, is always
pleasing to us, provided nothing be deduced from it
prejudicial to our liberties.’ Thereupon Hugues proposed
the alliance. Then Stephen de la Mare got up.
In 1519 he had shone in the foremost rank of the
patriots; but, an ardent Roman Catholic, he had since
then placed liberty in the second rank and the Church
in the first. It was he who had undertaken to oppose
the proposition. ‘It is sufficient for us to live under
the protection of God, St. Peter, and the bishop....
I oppose the alliance.’ De la Mare could not proceed,
so great was the confusion that broke out in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span>
assembly; the indignation was general, yet order and
quiet were restored at last, and the treaty was read.
‘Will you ratify this alliance?’ said first syndic G. Bergeron.
‘Yes, yes!’ they shouted on every side. The
syndic continued: ‘Let those who approve of it hold
up their hands!’ There was a forest of hands, every
man holding up both at once. ‘We desire it, we approve
of it,’ they shouted again. ‘Those of the contrary
opinion?’ added the syndic. Six hands only
were raised in opposition. Pierre de la Baume from
his episcopal throne looked down upon this spectacle
with anxiety. Even to the last he had reckoned upon
success. By selecting De la Mare, the old leader of
the patriots, and placing him at the head of the movement
against the alliance with the Swiss, he fancied
he had hit upon an admirable combination; but his
hopes were disappointed. Alarmed and irritated,
seeing what this vote would lead to, and determined
to keep his principality at any cost, the bishop-prince
exclaimed: ‘I do not consent to this alliance; I appeal
to our holy father the pope and to his majesty
the emperor.’ But to no purpose did the Bishop of
Geneva, on the eve of losing his states, appeal to powers
the most dreaded&mdash;no one paid any attention to his
protest. Joy beamed on every face, and the words
‘pope, emperor,’ were drowned by enthusiastic shouts
of ‘The Swiss ... the Swiss and liberty!’ Besan&ccedil;on
Hugues, who, although on the side of independence,
was attached to the bishop, exerted all his influence
with him. ‘Very well, then,’ said the versatile prelate,
‘if your franchises permit you to contract an
alliance without your prince, do so.’&mdash;‘I take note of
this declaration,’ said Hugues; and then he added:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span>
‘More than once the citizens have concluded such
alliances without their prince&mdash;with Venice, Cologne,
and other cities.’ The Register mentions that after
this the prince went away satisfied. We rather doubt
it; but however that may be, the bishop by his presence
had helped to sanction the measure which he
had so much at heart to prevent.<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">407</a></p>

<p>What comforted Pierre de la Baume was the sight
of Besan&ccedil;on Hugues at the head of the movement.
That great citizen assured the bishop that the alliance
with Switzerland was not opposed to his authority;
and he did so with perfect honesty.<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">408</a> Hugues was
simply a conservative. He desired an alliance with
Switzerland in order to preserve Geneva in her present
position. He desired to maintain the prelate not
only as bishop, but also as prince: all his opposition
was aimed at the usurpations of Savoy. But there
were minds in Geneva already wishing for more.
Certain citizens, in whom the new aspirations of modern
times were beginning to show themselves, said that
the municipal liberties of the city were continually
fettered, and often crushed, by the princely authority
of the bishop. Had he not been seen to favour the
cruel murders which the Savoyard power had committed
in Geneva? ‘The liberties of the people and
the temporal lordship of the bishop cannot exist together;
one or other of the two powers must succumb,’
they said. The history of succeeding ages has shown
but too plainly the reasonableness of these fears. Wherever
the bishop has remained king, he has trampled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span>
the liberties of the people under foot. There we find
no representative government, no liberty of the press,
no religious liberty. In the eyes of the bishop-prince
these great blessings of modern society are monsters to
be promptly stifled. Some Genevans comprehended the
danger that threatened them, and, wishing to preserve
the liberties they had received from their ancestors,
saw no other means than by withdrawing from the
ministers of religion a worldly power which Jesus
Christ had refused them beforehand. Some&mdash;but
their number was very small then&mdash;went further,
and began to ask whether the authority of a bishop in
religious matters was not still more contrary to the
precepts of the Gospel, which acknowledged no other
authority than that of the word of God; and whether
liberty could ever exist in the State so long as there
was a despot in the Church. Such were the great
questions beginning to be discussed in Geneva more
than three hundred years ago: the present time seems
destined to solve them.</p>

<p>In spite of the loyal assurances of Besan&ccedil;on Hugues,
the bishop was disturbed. Sitting with liberty at his
side, he felt ill at ease; and the terror spreading
through the ranks of the clergy could not fail to reach
him. If the Bishop of Geneva should be deprived of
his principality, who can tell if men will not one day
deprive the pope of his kingship? The alarm of the
canons, priests, and friends of the papacy continued
to increase. Did they not know that the Reformation
was daily gaining ground in many of the confederated
states? Friburg, indeed, was still catholic; but Zurich
was no longer so, and everything announced that
Berne would soon secede. The great light was to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span>
come from another country, from a country that spoke
the language of Geneva; but Geneva was then receiving
from Switzerland the first gleams that precede
the day. Some Genevans were already beginning to
profess, rather undisguisedly, their new religious tendencies;
Robert Vandel, the bishop’s friend, openly defended
the Reformation. ‘Sire Robert is not very good
for Friburg,’ said some; ‘but he is good for Berne, <i>very
good</i>!’ which meant that he preferred Holy Scripture
to the pope. The priests said that if Geneva was
united to Switzerland, there was an end of the privileges
of the clergy; that simple christians would begin
to occupy themselves with religion; and that in
Geneva, as in Basle, Schaffhausen, and Berne, laymen
would talk about the faith of the Church. Now there
was nothing of which the clergy were more afraid.
The ministers of the Romish religion, instead of examining
the Scriptures, of finding in them doctrines
capable of satisfying the wants of man, and of propagating
them by mild persuasion, were occupied with
very different matters, and would not suffer any one
but themselves to think even of the Bible and its contents.
Never was a calling made a more thorough fiction.
It was said of them: <i>They have taken away the
key of knowledge; they enter not in themselves, and them
that were entering in they hindered</i>.</p>

<p>These ideas became stronger every day, and the
attachment of the priests to their old customs was
more stubborn than ever. It was difficult to avoid
an outbreak; but it should be observed that it was
provoked by the canons. These rich and powerful
clerics, who were determined to oppose the alliance
with all their power, and, if necessary, to defend their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">417</span>
clerical privileges with swords and arquebuses, got
together a quantity of arms in the house of De Lutry,
the most fanatical of their number, in order to make
use of them ‘against the city.’ On the night of the
26th of February, these reverend seigniors, as well
as the principal mamelukes, crept one after another
into this house, and held a consultation. A rumour
spread through the city, and the citizens told one
another ‘that M. de Lutry and M. de Vausier had
brought together a number of people secretly to get
up a riot.’ The patriots, prompt and resolute in
character, were determined not to give the mamelukes
the least chance of recovering their power. ‘The
people rose in arms,’ the house was surrounded; it
would appear that some of the chiefs of the ducal
party came out, and that swords were crossed. ‘A
few were wounded,’ says the chronicler. However,
‘proclamation was made to the sound of the trumpet
through the city,’ and order was restored.<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">409</a></p>

<p>The conspiracy of the canons having thus failed,
the members of the feudal and papal party thought
everything lost. They fancied they saw an irrevocable
fatality dragging them violently to their destruction.
The principal supporters of the old order of things,
engrossed by the care of their compromised security,
thought only of escaping, like birds of night, before
the first beams of day. They disguised themselves
and slipped out unobserved, some by one gate, some by
another. It was almost a universal panic. The impetuous
Lutry escaped first, with one of his colleagues;
the bishop-prince’s turn came next. Bitterly upbraided
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span>
by the Count of Genevois for not having prevented the
alliance, Pierre de la Baume took alarm both at the
huguenots and the duke, and escaped to St. Claude.
The agents of his Highness of Savoy trembled in their
castles; the vidame hastened to depart on the one side,
and the gaoler of the Ch&acirc;teau de l’Ile, who was nick-named
the <i>sultan</i>, did the same on the other.</p>

<p>The most terrified were the clerics and the mamelukes
who had been present at the meeting at Canon
de Lutry’s. They had taken good care not to stop after
the alarm that had been given them, and when the
order was made by sound of trumpet for every man to
retire to his own house, they had hastened to escape
in disguise, trembling and hopeless. The next morning
the city watch, followed by the sergeants, forcibly
entered De Lutry’s house, and seized the arms, which
had been carefully hidden; but they found the nest
empty, for all the birds had flown. ‘If they had not
escaped,’ said Syndic Balard, ‘they would have been
in danger of death.’ The canons who had not taken
flight sent two of their number to the h&ocirc;tel-de-ville to
say to the syndics: ‘Will you keep us safe and sure
in the city? if not, will you give us a safe-conduct,
that we may leave it?’ They thought only of following
their colleagues.</p>

<p>The flight of the 26th of February was the counterpart
of that of the 15th of September. In September
the new times had disappeared in Geneva for a few
weeks only; in February the old times were departing
for ever. The Genevese rejoiced as they saw these
leeches disappear, who had bled them so long, even to
the very marrow. ‘The priests and the Savoyards,’
they said, ‘are like wolves driven from the woods by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span>
hunger: there is nothing left for them to take, and
they are compelled to go elsewhere for their prey.’
Nothing could be more favourable to the Swiss alliance
and to liberty than this general flight. The partisans
of the duke and of the bishop having evacuated the
city, the senate and the people remained masters. The
grateful citizens ascribed all the glory to God, and exclaimed:
‘The sovereignty is now in the hands of the
council, without the interference of either magistrates
or people. <i>Everything was done by the grace of God.</i>’<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">410</a></p>

<p>At the very time when the men of feudalism were
quitting Geneva, those of liberty were arriving, and the
great transition was effected. On the 11th of March
eight Swiss ambassadors entered the city in the
midst of a numerous crowd and under a salute of
artillery: they were the envoys from the cantons who
had come to receive the oaths of Geneva and give
theirs in return. The next day these freemen, sons
of the conquerors of Charles the Bold, all glowing
with desire to protect Geneva from the attacks of
Charles the Good, appeared before the general council.
At their head was Sebastian de Diesbach, an energetic
man, devout catholic, great captain, and skilful diplomatist.
‘Magnificent lords and very dear fellow-freemen,’
he said, ‘Friburg and Berne acquaint you
that they are willing to live and die with you.... Will
you swear to observe the alliance that has been drawn
up?’&mdash;‘Yes,’ exclaimed all the Genevans, without
one dissentient voice. Then the Swiss ambassadors
stood up and raised their hands towards heaven to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">420</span>
make the oath. Every one looked with emotion on
those eight Helvetians of lofty stature and martial
bearing, the representatives of the energetic populations
whose military glory at this time surpassed
that of all other nations. The noble Sebastian having
pronounced the oath of alliance, his companions
raised their hands also, and repeated his words
aloud. The citizens exclaimed with transport: ‘We
desire it, we desire it!’ Then with deep emotion said
some: ‘Those men were born in a happy hour, who
have brought about so good a business.’ Eight deputies
of Geneva, among whom were Francis Favre
and G. Hugues, brother of Besan&ccedil;on, proceeded to
Berne and Friburg to make the same oath on the
part of their fellow-citizens.<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">411</a></p>

<p>The men of the old times were not discouraged:
if they had been beaten at Geneva, might they not
conquer at Friburg and Berne? Indefatigable in
their exertions, they resolved to set every engine to
work in order to succeed. Stephen de la Mare, three
other deputies of the duke, Michael Nergaz, and
forty-two mamelukes went into Switzerland to break
off the alliance. But Friburg and Berne replied:
‘For nothing in the world will we depart from what
we have sworn.’ The hand of God was manifest, and
accordingly when Hugues heard of this answer, he
exclaimed: ‘God himself is conducting our affairs.’</p>

<p>Then was Geneva intoxicated with joy. On the
morrow after the taking of the oath in the general
council, the delight of the people broke out all over
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">421</span>
the city. Bonfires were lighted in the public places;
there was much dancing, masquerading, and shouting;
patriotic and satirical songs reechoed through the
streets; there was an outburst of happiness and
liberty. ‘When a people have been kept so long in
the leash,’ said Bonivard, ‘as soon as they are let
loose, they are apt to indulge in dangerous gambols.’<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">412</a></p>

<p>While the people were rejoicing after their fashion,
the wise men of the council resolved to show their
gratitude to God in another manner. The councils
issued a general pardon. Then an indulgence and
concord were proclaimed, and all bound themselves
to live in harmony. They went further: they desired
to repair the injustice of the old r&eacute;gime. ‘Bonivard,’
said some, ‘has been unjustly deprived of his
priory of St. Victor because of his patriotism.’&mdash;‘What
would you have us do?’ they answered; ‘the
pope has given the benefice to another.’&mdash;‘I should
not make it a serious matter of conscience to disobey
the pope,’ said Bonivard slily.&mdash;‘And as for us,’ said
the syndics, ‘we do not care much about him.’ In
later years the magistrates of Geneva gave the most
palpable proofs of this declaration; for the moment,
they confined themselves to resettling the ex-prior
in the house of which the pope had robbed him.
Another more important reparation had still to be
effected.</p>

<p>In this solemn hour, when the cause of liberty was
triumphing, amid the joyful shouts of a whole people,
two names were pronounced with sighs and even with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">422</span>
tears: ‘Berthelier! L&eacute;vrier!’ said the noblest of the
citizens. ‘We have reached the goal, but it was they
who traced out the road with their blood.’ An enfranchised
people ought not to be ungrateful to their
liberators. By a singular coincidence the anniversary
of Berthelier’s death revived more keenly the memory
of that disastrous event. On the 23rd of August a
hundred citizens appeared before the council: ‘Seven
years ago this very day,’ they said, ‘Philibert Berthelier
was beheaded in the cause of the republic; we
pray that his memory be honoured, and that, for such
end, a solemn procession shall march to the ringing of
bells from the church of St. Pierre to that of Our
Lady of Grace, where the hero’s head was buried.’
That was not without danger: Our Lady’s was on the
Savoy frontier, and his Highness’s soldiers might
easily have disturbed the ceremony. The council
preferred ordering a solemn service in memory of
Berthelier, L&eacute;vrier, and others who died for the
republic. The Genevans, acknowledging the great
blessings with which the hand of God had enriched
them, wished to repair all wrongs, honour all self-sacrifice,
and walk with a firm step in the paths of
justice and of liberty. It was by such sacrifices that
they meant to celebrate their deliverance.<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">413</a></p>

<p>Geneva did not stand alone in feeling these aspirations
towards modern times. It was doubtless in the
sixteenth century a great example of liberty; but the
movement tending towards new things was felt among
all those nations whom the Bible compares to a
troubled sea: the tide was rising over the whole
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">423</span>
surface. During the first half of the sixteenth century
Europe was awaking; the love of ancient learning
enlightened the mind, and the brilliant rays of christian
truth, so long intercepted, were beginning to pierce
the clouds. A world till then unknown was opening
before man’s astonished eyes, and everything seemed
to announce a civilisation, independence, and life as
yet unknown to the human race. The mind of Europe
awoke, and moving forward took its station
in the light, insatiable of life, of knowledge, and of
liberty.</p>

<p>The great question was to know whether the new
world, which seemed to be issuing from the abyss,
would repose on a solid foundation. More than once
already awakened society had appeared to break its
bonds, to throw off its shroud, and uplift the stone
from the sepulchre. It had happened thus in the
ninth, eleventh, and twelfth centuries, when the most
eminent minds began to ask the reason of things;<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">414</a>
but each time humanity had wanted the necessary
strength, the new birth was not completed, the tomb
closed over it again, and it fell once more into a
heavy slumber.</p>

<p>Would it be the same now? Would this awakening
of the sixteenth century be also like a watch in the
night?</p>

<p>Certain men, elect of God, were to give this new
movement the strength it needed. Let us turn
towards that country whence Geneva would receive
those heroes baptised with the Holy Spirit and with
fire.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">424</span></p>

<p>The scene of our history is about to change. ‘A
man of mark’ whom we have already quoted, said,
when speaking of Geneva: ‘On this platform appear
actors who do not speak so loud as great kings and
emperors on the spacious theatre of their states; but
what matters how the speaker is dressed, if he says
what he ought?’<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">415</a> We are leaving for a time this
modest platform. We shall no longer have to speak
of a little nation whose greatest heroes are obscure
citizens. We are entering a mighty empire where we
shall be in the company of kings and queens, of great
personages and famous courtiers. Yet the dissimilarity
between the two theatres is not so wide as one
might expect. In that vast country of France, where
historians usually describe nothing but the great
stream formed by the numerous combinations of
policy, a few springs are seen welling forth, at first
unnoticed, but they swell by degrees, and their waters
will one day have more influence on the destiny of
the world than the floods of that mighty river. One
of these springs appeared at Etaples, close upon the
shores of the Channel; another at Gap in Dauphiny;
and others in other places. But the most important,
that which was to unite them all and spread a new
life even to the most distant countries, welled up at
Noyon, an ancient and once illustrious town of Picardy.
It was France who gave Lef&egrave;vre and Farel&mdash;France,
too, gave Calvin. That French people, who
(as some say) cared for nothing but war and diplomacy;
that home of a philosophy often sceptical and
sometimes incredulous and mocking; that nation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">425</span>
which proclaimed and still proclaims itself the eldest
daughter of Rome, gave to the world the Reformation
of Calvin and of Geneva&mdash;the great Reformation,
that which is the strength of the most influential
nations, and which reaches even to the ends of the
world. France has no nobler title of renown: we do
not forget it. Perhaps she will not always disdain
it, and after having enriched others she will enrich
herself. It will be a great epoch for her future
development, when her dearest children drink at those
living fountains that burst from her bosom in the
sixteenth century, or rather at that eternal fountain
of the Word of God, whose waters are for the healing
of nations.

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> Reformation was concerned both with God
and man: its aim was to restore the paths by
which God and man unite, by which the Creator
enters again into the creature. This path, opened by
Jesus Christ with power, had been blocked up in
ages of superstition. The Reformation cleared the
road, and reopened the door.</p>

<p>We willingly acknowledge that the middle ages
had not ignored the wonderful work of redemption:
truth was then covered with a veil rather than destroyed,
and if the noxious weeds be plucked up with
which the field had gradually been filled, the primitive
soil is laid bare. Take away the worship paid to
the Virgin, the saints, and the host; take away meritorious,
magical, and supererogatory works, and other
errors besides, and we arrive at simple faith in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">428</span>
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. It is not the same
when we come to the manner in which God enters
again into man. Roman catholicism had gone astray
in this respect; there were a few mystics in her fold
who pretended to tread this mysterious way; but their
heated imaginations misled them, while in the place
of this inward worship the Roman doctors substituted
certain ecclesiastical formalities mechanically executed.
The only means of recovering this royal road was to
return to the apostolical times and seek for it in the
Gospel. Three acts are necessary to unite man again
with God. Religion penetrates into man by the depths
of his conscience; thence it rises to the height of his
knowledge, and finally pervades the activity of his
whole life.</p>

<p>The conscience of man had been seared not only
by the sin which clings to our nature, but also by
the indulgences and mortifications imposed by the
Church. It required to be vivified by faith in the
atoning blood of Christ.</p>

<p>Tradition, scholasticism, papal infallibility, mingling
their confused questions and numerous superstitions
with the natural darkness of the heart, man’s understanding
had been completely obscured. It needed to
be enlightened by the torch of God’s word.</p>

<p>A society of priests, exercising absolute dominion,
had enslaved christendom. For this theocratic and
clerical society it was necessary to substitute a living
society of the children of God.</p>

<p>With Luther began the awakening of the human
conscience. Terrified at the sin he discovered in himself,
he found no other means of peace but faith in
the grace of Christ Jesus. This starting-point of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">429</span>
German reformer was also that of every Reformation.</p>

<p>To Zwingle belongs in an especial manner the work
of the understanding. The first want of the Swiss
reformer was to know God. He inquired into <i>the
false and the true, the reason of faith</i>. Formed by the
study of the Greek classics, he had the gift of understanding
and interpreting Scripture, and as soon as
he reached Zurich he began his career as a reformer
by explaining the New Testament.</p>

<p>Calvin perfected the third work necessary for the
Reformation. His characteristic is not, as the world
imagines, the teaching of the doctrines to which he
has given his name; his great idea was to unite all
believers into one body, having the same life, and
acting under the same Chief. The Reform was essentially,
in his eyes, the renovation of the individual, of
the human mind, of christendom. To the Church
of Rome, powerful as a government, but otherwise
enslaved and dead, he wished to oppose a regenerated
Church whose members had found through faith the
liberty of the children of God, and which should be
not only a pillar of truth, but a principle of moral
purification for all the human race. He conceived
the bold design of forming for these modern times a
society in which the individual liberty and equality of
its members should be combined with adhesion to an
immutable truth, because it came from God, and to a
holy and strict, but freely accepted law. An energetic
effort towards moral perfection was one of the devices
written on his standard. Not only did he conceive
the grand idea we have pointed out; he realised it.
He gave movement and life to that enlightened and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">430</span>
sanctified society which was the object of his noble
desires. And now wherever churches are founded
on the twofold basis of truth and morality&mdash;even
should they be at the antipodes&mdash;we may affirm that
Calvin’s sublime idea is extended and carried out.</p>

<p>It resulted from the very nature of this society that
the democratic element would be introduced into the
nations where it was established. By the very act of
giving truth and morality to the members of this body,
he gave them liberty. All were called to search for
light in the Bible; all were to be taught immediately
of God, and not by priests only; all were called to give
to others the truth they had found. ‘Each one of you,’
said Calvin, ‘is consecrated to Christ, in order that
you may be associated with him in his kingdom, and be
partakers of his priesthood.’<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">416</a> How could the citizens
of this spiritual republic be thought otherwise than
worthy to have a share in its government? The
fifteenth chapter of the Acts shows us the <i>brethren</i>
united with the apostles and elders in the proceedings
of the Church, and such is the order that Calvin desired
to reestablish. We have already pointed out
some of the reasons by virtue of which constitutional
liberty was introduced into the bosom of the nations
who received the Reform of Geneva. To these must
be added the reason just mentioned.</p>

<p>Disunited from each other, the three great principles
of Luther, Zwingle, and Calvin would have been insufficient.
Faith, if it had not possessed for its foundation
the knowledge of the Word of God, would have easily
degenerated into a mystical enthusiasm. The abstract
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">431</span>
authority of Scripture, separated from a living faith,
would have ended in a dead orthodoxy; and the social
principle, deprived of these two foundations, would
have succeeded only in raising one of those artificial
edifices in the air which fall down as soon as built.</p>

<p>God, by giving in the sixteenth century a man who
to the lively faith of Luther and the scriptural understanding
of Zwingle joined an organising faculty and
a creative mind, gave the complete reformer. If Luther
laid the foundations, if Zwingle and others built the
walls, Calvin completed the temple of God.</p>

<p>We shall have to see how this doctor arrived at a
knowledge of the truth; we shall have to study his
labours and his struggles until the moment when,
quitting for ever a country whose soil trembled under
his feet and threatened to swallow him up, he went to
plant upon a lowly Alpine hill that standard around
which he meditated rallying the scattered members
of Jesus Christ. But we must first see what was the
state of France at the time when the reformer was
brought to the Gospel.</p>

<p>The history of the Reformation in France, prior to
the establishment of Calvin at Geneva, is divided into
two parts: the first includes the favourable times, the
second the unfavourable. We confess that the favourable
times were occasionally the reverse, and that the
unfavourable times were often favourable; and yet we
believe that, generally speaking, this distinction may be
justified. This subject has been frequently treated of;
we shall, however, have to describe some phases of the
French Reformation which have not always been set
forth by those who have written its history.</p>

<p>Two persons, a man and a woman, whose social
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">432</span>
position and character present the most striking contrasts,
laboured with particular zeal to propagate the
Gospel in France at the epoch of the Reformation.</p>

<p>The woman appears first. She is the most beautiful
and intelligent, the wittiest, most amiable and influential,
and, with the exception of her daughter, the
greatest of her age. Sister, mother of kings, herself
a queen, grandmother of the monarch whom France
(right or wrong) has extolled the most, namely,
Henry IV., she lived much in the great world, in
great ceremonials, with great personages, among the
magnificence of the Louvre, St. Germain, and Fontainebleau.
This woman is Margaret of Angoul&ecirc;me,
Duchess of Alen&ccedil;on, Queen of Navarre, and sister of
Francis I.</p>

<p>The man who appears next (he was younger than
her by seventeen years) contrasts with all these grandeurs
by the lowness of his origin. He is a man of
the people, a Picardin; his grandfather was a cooper at
Pont l’Ev&ecirc;que; his father was secretary to the bishop,
and, in the day of his greatest influence in the world, he
apprenticed his own brother Anthony to a bookbinder.
Simple, frugal, poor, of a disposition ‘rather morose
and bashful’<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">417</a>&mdash;such is the humble veil that hides
the greatness of his genius and the strength of his will.
This man is Calvin.</p>

<p>This man and this woman, so opposite as regards
their condition in the world, resemble each other in
their principal features. They both possess faith in
the great truths of the Gospel; they love Jesus Christ;
they have the same zeal for spreading with unwearied
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">433</span>
activity the truths so dear to them; they have the
same compassion for the miserable, and especially for
the victims of religious persecution. But while the
man sometimes presumes upon his manly strength, the
woman truly belongs to the weaker sex. She possesses
indeed a moral virtue which resists the seductions of
the age; she keeps herself pure in the midst of a depraved
court; but she has also that weakness which
disposes one to be too indulgent, and permits herself
to be led away by certain peculiarities of contemporary
society. We see her writing tales whose origin
may be explained and even justified, since their object
was to unveil the immorality of priests and monks,
but they are nevertheless a lamentable tribute paid to
the spirit of her age. While Calvin sets up against
the papacy <i>a forehead harder than adamant</i>, Margaret,
even in the days of her greatest zeal, is careful not to
break with Rome. At last she yields, outwardly at
least, to the sovereign commands of her brother, the
persevering hostility of the court, clergy, and parliament,
and though cherishing in her heart faith in the
Saviour who has redeemed her, conceals that faith
under the cloak of Romish devotion; while Calvin
propagates the Gospel, in opposition to the powers of
the world, saying: ‘Such as the warfare is, such are
the arms. If our warfare is spiritual, we ought to be
furnished with spiritual armour.’<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">418</a> Margaret doubtless
says the same thing; but she is the king’s sister,
summoned to his council, accustomed to diplomacy,
respected by foreign princes; she hopes that a union
with the evangelical rulers of Germany may hasten
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">434</span>
on the Reformation of France. Finally, while Calvin
desires <i>truth</i> in the Church above all things, Margaret
clings to the preservation of its <i>unity</i>, and thus becomes
the noble representative of a system still lauded by
some protestants&mdash;<i>to reform the Church without breaking
it up</i>: a specious system, impossible to be realised.
And yet this illustrious lady, in spite of her errors,
plays a great part in the history of the Reformation:
she was respected by the most pious reformers. An
impartial historian should brave hostile prejudices, and
assign her the place which is her due.</p>

<p>Let us enter upon the French Reformation at the
moment when, after great but isolated preparations, it
is beginning to occupy a place in the affairs of the
nation.<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">419</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The defeat at Pavia had plunged France into
mourning. There was not a house where they did
not weep for a son, a husband, or a father; and the
whole kingdom was plunged in sorrow at seeing its
king a prisoner. The recoil of this great disaster had
not long to be waited for. ‘The gods chastise us:
let us fall upon the christians,’ said the Romans of
the first centuries; the persecuting spirit of Rome
woke up in France. ‘It is our tenderness towards
the Lutherans that has drawn upon us the vengeance
of heaven,’ said the zealous catholics, who conceived
the idea of appeasing heaven by hecatombs.</p>

<p>The great news of Pavia which saddened all France
was received in Spain with transports of joy. At the
time when the battle was fought, the young emperor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">435</span>
was in Castile, anxiously expecting news from Italy.
On the 10th of March, 1525, he was discussing, in one
of the halls of the palace at Madrid, the advantages of
Francis I. and the critical situation of the imperial
army.<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">420</a> ‘We shall conquer,’ Pescara had written
to him, ‘or else we shall die.’ At this moment a
courier from Lombardy appeared at the gate of the
palace: he was introduced immediately. ‘Sire,’ said
he, bending the knee before the emperor in the midst
of his court, ‘the French army is annihilated, and the
King of France in your Majesty’s hands.’ Charles,
startled by the unexpected news, stood pale and
motionless; it seemed as if the blood had stagnated
in his veins. For some moments he did not
utter a word, and all around him, affected like
himself, looked at him in silence. At last the ambitious
prince said slowly, as if speaking to himself:
‘The king of France is my prisoner.... I have won
the battle.’ Then, without a word to any one, he entered
his bed-room and fell on his knees before an image
of the Virgin, to whom he gave thanks for the victory.
He meditated before this image on the great exploits
to which he now thought himself called. To become
the master of Europe, to reestablish everywhere the
tottering catholicism, to take Constantinople, and
even to recover Jerusalem&mdash;such was the task which
Charles prayed the Virgin to put him in a condition to
carry through. If these ambitious projects had been
realised, the revival of learning would have been compromised,
the Reformation ruined, the new ideas rooted
out, and the whole world would have bowed helplessly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">436</span>
beneath two swords&mdash;that of the emperor first, and
then that of the pope. At length Charles rose from his
knees; he read the humble letters of the King of
France, gave orders for processions to be made, and
attended mass next day with every mark of the
greatest devotion.<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">421</a></p>

<p>All christendom thought as this potentate did: a
shudder ran through Europe, and every man said to
himself as he bent his head: ‘Behold the master whom
the fates assign us!’ At Naples a devout voice was
heard to exclaim: ‘Thou hast laid the world at his
feet!’</p>

<p>It has been said that if in our day a king should be
made prisoner, the heir to the throne or a regent
would succeed to all his rights; but in the sixteenth
century, omnipotence dwelt in the monarch’s person,
and from the depths of his dungeon he could bind his
country by the most disastrous treaties.<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">422</a> Charles V.
determined to profit by this state of things. He
assembled his council. The cruel Duke of Alva eloquently
conjured him not to release his rival until
he had deprived him of all power to injure him. ‘In
whom is insolence more natural,’ he said, ‘in whom is
fickleness more instinctive than in the French? What
can we expect from a king of France?... Invincible
emperor, do not miss the opportunity of increasing the
authority of the empire, not for your own glory, but
for the service of God.’<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">423</a> Charles V. appeared to
yield to the duke’s advice, but it was advice according
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">437</span>
to his own heart; and while repeating that a christian
prince ought not to triumph in his victory over
another, he resolved to crush his rival. M. de
Beaurain, viceroy of Naples, Lannoy, and the Constable
of Bourbon, so detested by Francis I., waited
all three upon the royal captive.</p>

<p>Francis had overplayed the part of a suppliant, a
character so new for him. ‘Instead of a useless
prisoner,’ he had written to Charles, ‘set at liberty a
king who will be your slave for ever.’ Charles proposed
to him a dismemberment of France on three
sides. The Constable of Bourbon was to have Provence
and Dauphiny, and these provinces, united
with the Bourbonnais which he possessed already,
were to be raised into an independent kingdom. The
King of England was to have Normandy and Guienne;
and the emperor would be satisfied with French
Flanders, Picardy, and Burgundy.... When he heard
these monstrous propositions, Francis uttered a cry
and caught up his sword, which his attendants took
from his hands. Turning towards the envoys he
said: ‘I would rather die in prison than consent to
such demands.’ Thinking that he could make better
terms with the emperor, he soon after embarked at
Genoa and sailed to Spain. The delighted Charles
gave up to him the palace of Madrid, and employed
every means to constrain him to accept his disastrous
conditions.<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">424</a> Who will succeed in baffling the emperor’s
pernicious designs? A woman, Margaret of
Valois, undertook the task.<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">425</a> The statesmen of her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">438</span>
age considered her the best head in Europe; the
friends of the Reformation respected her as their
mother. Her dearest wish was to substitute a living
christianity for the dead forms of popery, and she
hoped to prevail upon her brother, ‘the father of
letters,’ to labour with her in this admirable work.
It was not in France only that she desired the triumph
of the Gospel, but in Germany, England, Italy, and
even Spain. As Charles’s projects would ruin all that
she loved&mdash;the king, France, and the Gospel&mdash;she
feared not to go and beard the lion even in his den.</p>

<p>The duchess as she entered Spain felt her heart
deeply agitated. The very day she had heard of the
battle of Pavia, she had courageously taken this heavy
cross upon her shoulders; but at times she fainted
under the burden. Impatient to reach her brother,
burning with desire to save him, fearing lest she
should find him dying, trembling lest the persecutors
should take advantage of her absence to crush the
Gospel and religious liberty in France, she found no
rest but at the feet of the Saviour. Many evangelical
men wept and prayed with her; they sought to raise
her drooping courage under the great trial which
threatened to weigh her down, and bore a noble
testimony to her piety. ‘There are various <i>stations</i>
in the christian life,’ said one of these reformers,
Capito. ‘You have now entered upon that commonly
called <i>the Way of the Cross</i>.<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">426</a> ... Despising the theology

<p>Margaret crossing in her litter (September 1525) the
plains of Catalonia, Arragon, and Castile, exclaimed:</p>

</div></div>

<p>She sometimes fancied that she could see in the
distance a messenger riding hastily from Madrid and
bringing her news of her brother.... But alas! her
imagination had deceived her, no one appeared. She
then wrote:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>Once or twice a day she halted at some inn on the
road to Madrid, but it was not to eat. ‘I have
supped only once since my departure from Aigues-Mortes,’
she said.<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">429</a> As soon as she entered the
wretched chamber, she began to write to her brother
at the table or on her knees. ‘Nothing to do you
service,’ she wrote: ‘nothing, even to casting the
ashes of my bones to the wind, will be strange or
painful to me; but rather consolation, repose, and
honour.’<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">430</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">440</span></p>

<p>The defeat of Pavia and the excessive demands of
Charles V. had given the king such shocks that he had
fallen seriously ill; the emperor had therefore gone to
Madrid to be near him. On Wednesday, September 19,
1525, Margaret arrived in that capital. Charles
received her surrounded by a numerous court, and
respectfully approaching her, this politic and phlegmatic
prince kissed her on the forehead and offered her his
hand. Margaret, followed by the noble dames and
lords of France who had accompanied her, and wearing
a plain dress of black velvet without any ornament,
passed between two lines of admiring courtiers. The
emperor conducted her as far as the door of her
brother’s apartments, and then withdrew.</p>

<p>Margaret rushed in; but alas! what did she find?
a dying man, pale, worn, helpless. Francis was on the
brink of the grave, and his attendants seemed to be
waiting for his last breath. The duchess approached
the bed softly, so as not to be heard by the sick man;
unobserved she fixed on him a look of the tenderest
solicitude, and her soul, strengthened by an unwavering
faith, did not hesitate; she believed in her
brother’s cure, she had prayed so fervently. She
seemed to hear in the depths of her heart an answer
from God to her prayers; and while all around the
prince, who was almost a corpse, bowed their heads in
dark despair, Margaret raised hers with hope towards
heaven.</p>

<p>Prudent, skilful, decided, active, a Martha as well
as a Mary, she established herself at once in the king’s
chamber, and took the supreme direction. ‘If she
had not come he would have died,’ said Brant&ocirc;me.<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">431</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">441</span>
‘I know my brother’s temperament,’ she said, ‘better
than the doctors.’ In spite of their resistance, she
had the treatment changed; then she sat down at the
patient’s bedside, and left him no more. While the
king slept, she prayed; when he awoke, she spoke to
him in encouraging language. The faith of the sister
gradually dispelled the brother’s dejection. She
spoke to him of the love of Christ; she proposed to
him to commemorate his atoning death by celebrating
the holy eucharist. Francis consented. He had
hardly communicated when he appeared to wake up
as if from a deep sleep; he sat up in his bed, fixed his
eyes on his sister, and said: ‘God will heal me body
and soul.’ Margaret in great emotion answered:
‘Yes, God will raise you up again and make you
free.’ From that hour the king gradually recovered
his strength, and he would often say: ‘But for her, I
was a dead man.’<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">432</a></p>

<p>Margaret, seeing her brother restored to life, thought
only of restoring him to liberty. She departed for
Toledo, where Charles V. was staying; the seneschal
and seneschaless of Poitou, the Bishop of Senlis, the
Archbishop of Embrun, the president De Selves, and
several other nobles, accompanied her. What a journey!
Will she succeed in touching her brother’s
gaoler, or will she fail? This question was continually
before her mind. Hope, fear, indignation moved her
by turns; at every step her agitation increased. The
emperor went out courteously to meet her; he helped
her to descend from her litter, and had his first conversation
with her in the Alcazar, that old and magnificent
palace of the Moorish kings. Charles V. was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">442</span>
determined to take advantage of his victory. Notwithstanding
the outward marks of politeness, exacted
by the etiquette of courts, he wrapped himself up in
imperturbable dignity, and was cold, nay, almost
harsh. Margaret, seeing that her brother’s conqueror
kept the foot upon his neck, and was determined not
to remove it, could no longer contain herself. ‘She
broke out into great anger:’<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">433</a> like a lioness robbed of
her cubs, full of majesty and fury, she startled the
cold and formal Charles, says Brant&ocirc;me. Yet he
restrained himself, preserved his icy mien, made no
answer to the duchess, and busying himself with
showing her the honours due to her rank, he conducted
her, accompanied by the Archbishop of Toledo
and several Spanish noblemen, to the palace of Don
Diego de Mendoza, which had been prepared for her.</p>

<p>Alone in her chamber the princess gave free vent
to her tears; she wrote to Francis: ‘I found him very
cold.’<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">434</a> She reminded him that the King of heaven
‘has placed on his throne <i>an ensign of grace</i>; that we
have no reason to fear the majesty of heaven will reject
us; and that he stretches out his hand to us, even
before we seek for it.’ And being thus strengthened,
she prepared for the solemn sitting at which she was
to plead her brother’s cause. She quitted the palace
with emotion to appear before the council extraordinary,
at which the emperor and his ministers sat with
all the grandeur and pride of Castile. Margaret was
not intimidated, and though she could not perceive
the least mark of interest on the severe and motionless
faces of her judges, ‘she was triumphant in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">443</span>
speaking and pleading.’ But she returned bowed
down with sorrow: the immovable severity of the
emperor and of his councillors dismayed her. ‘The
thing is worsened,’ she said, ‘far more than I had
imagined.’<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">435</a></p>

<p>The Duchess of Alen&ccedil;on, firmer than her brother,
would not agree to the cession of Burgundy. The
emperor replied with irritation: ‘It is my patrimonial
estate&mdash;I still bear the name and the arms.’ The
duchess, confounded by Charles’s harshness, threw
herself into the arms of God. ‘When men fail, God
does not forget,’ she said. She clung to the rock;
‘she leant,’ says Erasmus, ‘upon the unchangeable
rock which is called Christ.’<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">436</a></p>

<p>She soon regained her courage, asked for another
audience, returned to the attack, and her agitated
soul spoke with new eloquence to the emperor and
his ministers. Never had the Escurial or the Alcazar
seen a petitioner so ardent and so persevering. She
returned to her apartments in alternations of sorrow
and joy. ‘Sometimes I get a kind word,’ she wrote,
‘and then suddenly all is changed. I have to deal
with the greatest of dissemblers.’<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">437</a> This beautiful
and eloquent ambassadress filled the Spaniards with
admiration. They talked at court of nothing but the
sister of Francis I. Letters received in France and
Germany from Madrid and Toledo extolled her sweetness,
energy, and virtues. The scholars of Europe
felt their love and respect for her increase, and were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">444</span>
proud of a princess whom they looked upon as their
M&aelig;cenas. What charmed them was something more
than that inquiring spirit which had led Margaret in
her earliest years towards literature and divinity, and
had made her learn Latin and Hebrew;<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">438</a> Erasmus enthusiastically
exclaimed when he heard of the wonders
she was doing in Spain: ‘How can we help loving,
in God, such a heroine, such an amazon?’<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">439</a> The
courage with which the Duchess of Alen&ccedil;on had gone
to Spain to save her brother led some christians to
imagine that she would display the same heroism in
delivering the Church from her long captivity.

(1525-1526.)</span></h2>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> captive Francis was not Margaret’s only
sorrow. If her brother was a prisoner to the
emperor, her brethren in the faith were prisoners to
her mother. The parliament of Paris having issued
a decree against the Lutherans, and the pope having
on the 17th of March invested with apostolical authority
the councillors authorised to proceed against
them,<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">440</a> the persecutors set vigorously to work. The
regent Louisa of Savoy, mother of Francis I. and of
Margaret, inquired of the Sorbonne: ‘By what means
the <i>damnable doctrine</i> of Luther could be extirpated?’
The fanatic Beda, syndic of that corporation,
enchanted with such a demand, replied without hesitation
on the part of the Faculties: ‘It must be
punished with the utmost severity.’ Accordingly
Louisa published letters-patent, ‘<i>to extinguish the
damnable heresy of Luther</i>.’<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">441</a></p>

<p>France began to seek in persecution an atonement
for the faults which had led to the defeat of Pavia.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">446</span>
Many evangelical christians were either seized or
banished. Marot, valet-de-chambre to the Duchess
of Alen&ccedil;on, the best poet of his age, who never
spared the priests, and translated the Psalms of David
into verse, was arrested; Lef&egrave;vre, Roussel, and others
had to flee; Caroli and Mazurier recanted the faith
they had professed.<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">442</a> ‘Alas!’ said Roussel, ‘no one
can confess Jesus any longer except at the risk of his
life.’<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">443</a>&mdash;‘It is the hour of triumph,’<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">444</a> proudly said
Beda and the men of the Roman party. A blow more
grievous still was about to reach Margaret.</p>

<p>A gentleman, a friend of Erasmus, of letters, and
especially of Scripture, who had free access to the
court of the duchess, and with whom that princess
loved to converse about the Gospel and the new times&mdash;Berquin
had been arrested on a charge of heresy;
then set at liberty in 1523 by the intercession of
Margaret and the king’s orders. Leaving Paris, he
had gone to his native province of Artois. A man of
upright heart, generous soul, and intrepid zeal, ‘in
whom you could see depicted the marks of a great
mind,’ says the chronicler, he worthily represented
by his character that nobility of France, and especially
of Artois, so distinguished at all times by its devotedness
and valour. Happy in the liberty which God
had given him, Berquin had sworn to consecrate it to
him, and was zealously propagating in the cottages
on his estate the doctrine of salvation by <i>Christ alone</i>.<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">445</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">447</span>
The ancient country of the Atrebates, wonderfully
fertile as regards the fruits of the earth, was equally
fertile as regards the seed from heaven. Berquin
attacked the priesthood such as Rome had made it.
He said: ‘You will often meet with these words in
Holy Scripture: <i>honourable marriage</i>, <i>undefiled bed</i>,
but of <i>celibacy</i> you will not find a syllable.’ Another
time he said: ‘I have not yet known a monastery
which was not infected with hatred and dissension.’
Such language, repeated in the refectories and long
galleries of the convents, filled the monks with anger
against this noble friend of learning. But he did not
stop there: ‘We must teach the Lord’s flock,’ he said,
‘to pray with understanding, that they may no longer
be content to gabble with their lips like ducks with
their bills, without comprehending what they say.’&mdash;‘He
is attacking us,’ said the chaplains. Berquin did
not, however, always indulge in this caustic humour;
he was a pious christian, and desired to see a holy
and living unity succeed the parties that divided the
Roman Church. He said: ‘We ought not to hear
these words among christians; I am of the Sorbonne,
I am of Luther; or, I am a Grey-friar, or Dominican,
or Bernardite.... Would it be too much then to say:
<i>I am a christian</i>?... Jesus who came for us all ought
not to be divided by us.’<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">446</a></p>

<p>But this language aroused still greater hatred. The
priests and nobles, who were firmly attached to ancient
usages, rose up against him; they attacked him in
the parishes and ch&acirc;teaux, and even went to him
and strove to detach him from the new ideas which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">448</span>
alarmed them. ‘Stop!’ they said with a sincerity
which we cannot doubt, ‘stop, or it is all over with
the Roman hierarchy.’ Berquin smiled, but moderated
his language; he sought to make men understand
that God loves those whom he calls to believe in
Jesus Christ, and applied himself ‘to scattering the
divine seed’ with unwearied courage. With the
Testament in his hand, he perambulated the neighbourhood
of Abbeville, the banks of the Somme, the
towns, manors, and fields of Artois and Picardy,
filling them with the Word of God.</p>

<p>These districts were in the see of Amiens, and every
day some noble, priest, or peasant went to the palace
and reported some evangelical speech or act of this
christian gentleman. The bishop, his vicars and canons
met and consulted together. On a sudden the bishop
started for Paris, eager to get rid of the evangelist who
was creating a disturbance throughout the north of
France. He waited upon the archbishop and the
doctors of the Sorbonne; he described to them the
heretical exertions of the gentleman, the irritation of
the priests, and the scandal of the faithful. The Sorbonne
assembled and went to work: unable to seize
Berquin, they seized his books, examined them, and
‘after the <i>manner of spiders</i> sucked from them certain
articles,’ says Crespin, ‘to make poison and bring
about the death of a person who, with integrity and
simplicity of mind, was endeavouring to advance
the doctrine of God.’<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">447</a> Beda especially took a
violent part against the evangelist. This suspicious
and arbitrary doctor, a thorough inquisitor, who possessed
a remarkable talent for discovering in a book
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">449</span>
everything that could ruin a man by the help of
forced interpretations, was seen poring night and day
over Berquin’s volumes. He read in them: ‘The
Virgin Mary is improperly invoked instead of the
Holy Ghost.’&mdash;‘Point against the accused,’ said
Beda.&mdash;He continued: ‘There are no grounds for
calling her a treasury of grace, our hope, our life: qualities
which belong essentially to our Saviour alone.’&mdash;Confirmation!&mdash;‘Faith
alone justifies.’&mdash;Deadly
heresy!&mdash;‘Neither the gates of hell, nor Satan, nor
sin can do anything against him who has faith in
God.’&mdash;What insolence!<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">448</a> Beda made his report: ‘Of
a truth,’ said his colleagues, ‘that is enough to bring
any man to the stake.’</p>

<p>Berquin’s death being decided upon, the Sorbonne
applied to the parliament, who raised no objections in
the matter. A man was put to death in those times for
an offensive passage in his writings; it was the censorship
of a period just emerging from the barbarism of the
middle ages. Demailly, an officer of the court, started
for Abbeville, proceeded to the gentleman’s estate, and
arrested him in the name of the law. His vassals, who
were devoted to him, murmured and would have risen
to defend him; but Berquin thought himself strong in
his right; he remembered besides these words of the
Son of God: ‘<i>Whosoever shall compel thee to go a
mile, go with him twain</i>;’ he entreated his friends to
let him depart, and was taken to the prison of the
Conciergerie, which he entered with a firm countenance
and unbending head.<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">449</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">450</span></p>

<p>This sad news which reached the Duchess of Alen&ccedil;on
in Spain moved her deeply, and while she was hurrying
from Madrid to Toledo, Alcala, and Guadalaxara,
soliciting everybody, ‘plotting’ her brother’s marriage
with the sister of Charles V., and thus paving the
way to the reconciliation of the two potentates, she
resolved to save her brethren exiled or imprisoned for
the Gospel. She applied to the king, attacking him
on his better side. Francis I., Brant&ocirc;me tells us, was
called the father of letters. He had sought for learned
men all over Europe and collected a fine library at
Fontainebleau.<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">450</a> ‘What!’ said his sister to him, ‘you
are founding a college at Paris intended to receive the
enlightened men of foreign countries; and at this very
time illustrious French scholars, Lef&egrave;vre of Etaples
and others, are compelled to seek an asylum out of
the kingdom.... You wish to be a propagator of
learning, while musty hypocrites, black, white, and
grey, are endeavouring to stifle it at home.’<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">451</a> Margaret
was not content to love with word and tongue;
she showed her love by her works. The thought of
the poor starving exiles, who knew not where to lay
their heads, haunted her in the magnificent palaces
of Spain; she distributed four thousand gold pieces
among them, says one of the enemies of the Reformation.<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">452</a></p>

<p>She did more: she undertook to win over her
brother to the Gospel, and endeavoured, she tells us,
to rekindle <i>the true fire</i> in his heart; but alas! that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">451</span>
fire had never burnt there. Touched, however, by
an affection so lively and so pure, by a devotedness so
complete, which would have gone, if necessary, even
to the sacrifice of her life, Francis, desirous of giving
Margaret a token of his gratitude, commanded the
parliament to adjourn until his return all proceedings
against the evangelicals. ‘I intend,’ he added,
‘to give the men of letters special marks of my
favour.’ These words greatly astonished the Sorbonne
and the parliament, the city and the court.
They looked at each other with an uneasy air; grief,
they said, had affected the king’s judgment. ‘Accordingly
they paid no great attention to his letter, and
on the 24th of November, 1525, twelve days after its
receipt, orders were given to the bishop to supply the
money necessary for the prosecution of the heretics.’<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">453</a></p>

<p>Margaret had no time to sympathise any longer
with the fate of her friends. Charles V., who spoke
with admiration of this princess, thought, not without
reason, that she encouraged the king to resist him;
he proposed, therefore, to make her a prisoner, as
soon as her safe-conduct had expired. It appears
that it was Montmorency who, being warned of the
emperor’s intention by the secret agents of the regent,
gave information to the duchess. Her task in Spain
seemed finished; it was from France now that the
emperor must be worked upon. Indeed, Francis,
disgusted with the claims of that prince, had signed
his abdication and given it to his sister. The French
government with this document in their hands might
give a new force to their demands. Margaret quitted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">452</span>
Madrid, and on the 19th of November she was at
Alcala.<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">454</a> But as she fled, she looked behind and
asked herself continually how she could save Francis
from the ‘purgatory of Spain.’ Yet the safe-conduct
was about to expire, the fatal moment had arrived;
the alguazils of Charles were close at hand. Getting
on horseback at six in the morning, the duchess made
a four days’ journey in one, and reentered France just
one hour before the termination of the truce.</p>

<p>Everything changed at Madrid. Charles, alarmed
at the abdication of Francis, softened by the approaching
marriage of this monarch with his sister,
obtaining in fine the main part of his demands, consented
to restore the King of France to liberty. It
was Burgundy that had delayed the arrangement.
The king was not more inclined than the duchess to
detach this important province from France; the only
difference between the brother and the sister was, that
the religion of the one looked upon oaths as sacred,
while the religion of the other made no account of
breaking them; and this Francis soon showed. On
the 14th of January, 1526, some of his courtiers, officers,
and domestics gathered round their master for an
act which in their simplicity they called sacred. The
king swore in their presence that he would not keep
one of the articles which Charles wished to force upon
him. When that was done Francis bound himself an
hour after by an oath, with his hand upon the Scriptures,
to do what Charles demanded. According to the
tenor of the treaty, he renounced all claim to Italy;
surrendered Burgundy to the emperor, to whom it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">453</span>
was stated to belong; restored Provence, which Charles
ceded to the Constable of Bourbon; and thus France
was laid prostrate.<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">455</a> The treaty was communicated
to the pope: ‘Excellent,’ he said, after reading it;
‘provided the king does not observe it.’ That was a
point on which Clement and Francis were in perfect
accord.<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">456</a></p>

<p>Margaret had had no hand in this disgraceful trick;
her only thought had been to save the king and the
evangelicals.

<span class="small">WILL THE REFORMATION CROSS THE RHINE?<br />

(1525-1526.)</span></h2>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Margaret</span>, who returned from Spain full of
hope in her brother’s deliverance, was determined
to do all in her power for the triumph of the Gospel.
While the men of the ultramontane party, calling
to mind the defeat of Pavia, demanded that heaven
should be appeased by persecutions, Margaret thought,
on the contrary, that humiliated France ought to turn
towards Jesus Christ, in order to obtain from him a
glorious deliverance.</p>

<p>But would Francis tread in his sister’s steps?
History presents few characters more inconsistent
than the character of this prince. He yielded at one
time to Margaret, at another to the Sorbonne. He
imprisoned and set free, he riveted the chains and
broke them. All his actions were contradictory; all
his projects seemed to exclude each other: on his
bright side, he was the father of letters; on his dark
side, the enemy of all liberty, especially of that which
the Gospel gives; and he passed with ease from one
of these characters to the other. Yet the influence
which Margaret exercised over him in favour of the
reformed seemed strongest during the eight or nine
years that followed his captivity; Francis showed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">455</span>
himself not unfavourable to the evangelicals during
this period, except at times when irritated by certain
excesses. Like a capricious and fiery steed, he sometimes
felt a fly stinging him, when he would rear
and throw his rider; but he soon grew calm and
resumed his quiet pace. Accordingly many persons
thought during the years 1525-1534 that the country
of St. Bernard and Waldo would not remain behind
Germany, Switzerland, and England. If the Reform
had been completed, France would have been saved
from the abominations of the Valois, the despotism of
the Bourbons, and the enslaving superstitions of the
popes.</p>

<p>Nine years before, the Reformation had begun in
Germany: would it not cross the Rhine?... Strasburg
is the main bridge by which German ideas enter France,
and French ideas make their way into Germany.
Many have already passed, both good and bad, from
the right bank to the left, and from the left to the
right; and will still pass as long as the Rhine continues
to flow. In 1521 the movement had been
very active. There had been an invasion at Strasburg
of the doctrines and writings of Luther: his name
was in every mouth. His noble conduct at the
diet of Worms had enraptured Germany, and the
news spread in every direction. Men repeated his
words, they devoured his writings. Zell, priest of
St. Lawrence and episcopal penitentiary, was one of
the first awakened. He began to seek truth in the
Scriptures, to preach that man is saved by grace; and
his sermons made an immense impression.</p>

<p>A nobleman of this city, Count Sigismond of
Haute-Flamme (in German Hohenlohe), a friend and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">456</span>
ally of the duchess, who called him her <i>good cousin</i>,
was touched with Luther’s heroism and the preaching
of Zell. His conscience was aroused; he endeavoured
to live according to the will of God; and feeling
within him the sin that prevented it, he experienced
the need of a Saviour, and found one in Jesus Christ.
Sigismond was not one of those nobles, rather
numerous then, who spoke in secret of the Saviour,
but, before the world, seemed not to know him;
Lambert of Avignon<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">457</a> admired his frankness and his
courage.<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">458</a> Although a dignitary of the Church and
dean of the great chapter, the count laboured to
spread evangelical truth around him, and conceived at
the same time a great idea. Finding himself placed between
the two countries and speaking both languages,
he resolved to set himself the task of bringing into
France the great principles of the Reformation. As
soon as he received any new work of Luther’s, he had
it translated into French and printed, and forwarded it
to the king’s sister.<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">459</a> He did more than that; he wrote
to Luther, begging him to send a letter to the duchess,
or even compose some work calculated to encourage
her in her holy undertakings.<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">460</a> The count, who knew
Margaret’s spirit and piety, and her influence over
the king, doubted not that she was the door by which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">457</span>
the new ideas which were to renovate the world,
would penetrate into France. He composed and
published himself a work entitled the <i>Book of the
Cross</i>, in which he set forth the death of Christ as
the essence of the Gospel.</p>

<p>Sigismond’s labours with the priests and nobles
around him were not crowned with success. The
monks especially looked at him with astonishment,
and replied that they would take good care not to
change the easy life they were leading. Lambert,
who had a keen eye, perceived this, and said to the
count with a smile: ‘You will not succeed; these
folks are afraid of damaging their wallets, their kitchens,
their stables, and their bellies.’<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">461</a></p>

<p>But he succeeded better with Margaret. He had
no sooner heard of the defeat at Pavia than he wrote
her a letter full of sympathy. ‘May God reward
you,’ she answered, ‘for the kindness you have done
us in visiting with such tender love the mother and
the daughter, both poor afflicted widows! You show
that you are not only a cousin according to flesh and
blood, but also according to the spirit. We have resolved
to follow your advice, so far as the Father of
all men is propitious to us.’<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">462</a> Sigismond wrote
again to the duchess while she was in Spain; and
when he heard of her return to France, manifested
a desire to go to Paris to advance the work of the
Reformation. He was at the same time full of confidence
in Margaret’s zeal. ‘You think me more
advanced than I am,’ she replied; ‘but I hope that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">458</span>
He who, in despite of my unworthiness, inspires you
with this opinion of me, will deign also to perfect his
work in me.’<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">463</a></p>

<p>The Duchess of Alen&ccedil;on did not however desire, as
we have said, a reformation like that of Luther or
Calvin. She wished to see in the Church a sincere
and living piety, preserving at the same time the
bishops and the hierarchy. To change the inside, but
to leave the outside standing&mdash;such was her system.
If they left the Church, two evils would in her opinion
result which she wished to avoid: first, it would excite
an insurmountable opposition; and second, it
would create divisions and lead to the rupture of
unity. She hoped to attain her ends by a union between
France and Germany. If Germany excited
France, if France moderated Germany, would they
not attain to a universal Reformation of the Church?
She had not drawn up her plan beforehand, but circumstances
gradually led her to this idea, which was
not her own only, but that of her brother’s most influential
advisers, and which was sometimes that of
her brother himself. Would she succeed?... Truth
is proud and will not walk in concert with error.
Besides, Rome is proud also, and, if this system had
prevailed, she would no doubt have profited by the
moderation of the reformers to maintain all her abuses.</p>

<p>The great event which Margaret was waiting for
magnified her hopes. Whenever Francis I. passed the
Pyrenees, it would be in her eyes like the sun rising
in the gates of the east to inundate our hemisphere
with its light. Margaret doubted not that her brother
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">459</span>
would immediately gather round him all the
friends of the Gospel, like planets round the orb of
day. ‘Come in the middle of April,’ she wrote to
Hohenlohe, who was in her eyes a star of the first
magnitude; ‘you will find all your friends assembled....
The spirit, which by a living faith unites you
to your only Chief (Jesus Christ), will make you
diligently communicate your assistance to all who
need it, especially to those who are united to you in
spirit and in faith. As soon as the king returns to
France, he will send to them and seek them in his
turn.’ Margaret imagined herself already at the
court of France, with the count at her side, and
around her the exiles, the prisoners, the doctors....
What an effect this mass of light would have upon
the French! All the ice of scholastic catholicism
would melt before the rays of the sun. ‘There will
indeed be some trouble at first,’ she said; ‘but the
Word of truth will be heard.... <i>God is God</i>. He is
what he is, not less invisible than incomprehensible.
His glory and his victory are spiritual. He is conqueror
when the world thinks him conquered.’<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">464</a></p>

<p>The king was still a prisoner; the regent and Duprat,
who were opposed to the Reformation, wielded
supreme power; the priests, seeing the importance of
the moment, united all their efforts to combat the
evangelical influences, and obtained a brilliant triumph.
On Monday, the 5th of February, 1526, a month before
the return of Francis I., the sound of the trumpet
was heard in all the public places of Paris, and a little
later in those of Sens, Orleans, Auxerre, Meaux, Tours,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">460</span>
Bourges, Angers, Poitiers, Troyes, Lyons, and Macon,
and ‘in all the bailiwicks, seneschallies, provostries,
viscounties, and estates of the realm.’ When the trumpet
ceased, the herald cried by order of parliament:&mdash;‘All
persons are forbidden to put up to sale or translate
from Latin into French the epistles of St. Paul,
the Apocalypse, and <i>other books</i>. Henceforward no
printer shall print any of the books of Luther. No
one shall speak of the ordinances of the Church or of
images, otherwise than Holy Church ordains. All
books of the Holy Bible, translated into French,
shall be given up by those who possess them, and
carried within a week to the clerks of the court. All
prelates, priests, and their curates shall forbid their
parishioners to have <i>the least doubt</i> of the catholic
faith.’<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">465</a> Translations, books, explanations, and even
doubts were prohibited.</p>

<p>This proclamation afflicted Margaret very seriously.
Will her brother ratify these fierce monastic prohibitions,
or will he cooperate in the victory of truth?
Will he permit the Reformation to pass from Germany
into France? One circumstance filled the
Duchess of Alen&ccedil;on with hope: the king declared in
favour of Berquin. It will be recollected that this
gentleman had been imprisoned in the Conciergerie.
Three monks, his judges, entered his prison, and reproached
him with having said that ‘the gates of hell
can do nothing against him who has faith.’ This notion
of a salvation entirely independent of priests
exasperated the clergy.&mdash;‘Yes,’ answered Berquin,
‘when the eternal Son of God receives the sinner who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">461</span>
believes in his death and makes him a child of God,
this divine adoption cannot be forfeited.’ The monks,
however, could see nothing but a culpable enthusiasm
in this joyful confidence. Berquin sent Erasmus
the propositions censured by his judges. ‘I find
nothing impious in them,’ replied the prince of the
schools.</p>

<p>The Sorbonne did not think the same. The prior
of the Carthusians, the prior of the Celestines, monks
of all colours, ‘imps of antichrist,’ says the chronicler,
‘gave help to the band of the Sorbonne in order to
destroy by numbers the firmness of Berquin.’&mdash;‘Your
books will be burnt,’ said the pope’s delegates to the
accused, ‘you will make an apology, and then only
will you escape. But if you refuse what is demanded
of you, you will be led to the stake.’&mdash;‘I will not
yield a single point,’ he answered. Whereupon the
Sorbonnists, the Carthusians, and the Celestines exclaimed:
‘Then it is all over with you!’ Berquin
waited calmly for the fulfilment of these threats.</p>

<p>When the Duchess of Alen&ccedil;on heard of all this,
she immediately wrote to her brother, and fell at her
mother’s knees. Louisa of Savoy was not inaccessible
to compassion, in the solemn hour that was to decide
her son’s liberty. That princess was one of those profane
characters who think little of God in ordinary
times, but cry to him when the sea in its rage is about
to swallow them up. Shut in her closet with Margaret,
she prayed with her that God would restore the
king to France. The duchess, full of charity and a
woman of great tact, took advantage of one of these
moments to attempt to soften her mother in favour of
Berquin. She succeeded: the regent was seized with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">462</span>
a sudden zeal, and ordered the pope’s delegates to
suspend matters until after the king’s return.<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">466</a></p>

<p>The delegates, in great surprise, read the letter over
and over again: it seemed very strange to them. They
deliberated upon it, and, thinking themselves of more
consequence than this woman, quietly pursued their
work. The haughty and resolute Louisa of Savoy, having
heard of their insolence, was exasperated beyond
measure, and ordered a second letter to be written to
the pontiff’s agents,<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">467</a> who contented themselves with
saying ‘<i>Non possumus</i>,’ and made the more haste, for
fear their victim should escape them. The king’s
mother, still more irritated, applied to the parliament,
who held Berquin in respect, and who said boldly that
the whole thing was nothing but a monkish conspiracy.
At this the members of the Roman party made a still
greater disturbance. Many of them (we must acknowledge)
thought they were doing the public a
service. ‘Erasmus is an apostate,’ they said, ‘and
Berquin is his follower.<a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">468</a> ... Their opinions are heretical,
schismatic, scandalous.... We must burn Erasmus’s
books ... and Berquin with them.’<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">469</a></p>

<p>But Margaret did not lose courage. She recollected
that the widow in the Gospel had obtained her request
by her importunity. She entreated her mother, she
wrote to her brother: ‘If you do not interfere, Berquin
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">463</span>
is a dead man.’<a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">470</a> Francis I. yielded to her prayer,
and wrote to the first president that he, the king, would
make him answerable for Berquin’s life if he dared to
condemn him. The president stopped all proceedings;
the monks hung their heads, and Beda and his friends,
says the chronicler, ‘were nigh bursting with vexation.’<a id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">471</a></p>

<p>Yet Margaret did not hide from herself that she
had still a hard struggle before her, which would require
strength and perseverance. She felt the need
of support to bring to a successful end in France
a transformation similar to that which was then renewing
Germany. The Count of Hohenlohe, at Strasburg,
was not enough: she wanted at her side a staff
that would enable her to bear with her brother’s
rebukes. God appeared willing to give her what she
wished.</p>

<p>There was at court a prince, young, lively, witty,
handsome, brave and gay, though somewhat harsh at
times: he had already gone through surprising adventures,
and, what was no small recommendation in
Margaret’s eyes, had been the companion of Francis in
the field and in prison. He was Henry d’Albret, King
of Navarre&mdash;king by right, if not in fact&mdash;and at that
time twenty-four years old. Community of misfortune
had united Francis and Henry in close friendship, and
young d’Albret soon conceived a deep affection for his
friend’s sister. Henry loved learning, possessed great
vivacity of temper, and spoke with facility and even
with eloquence. It was a pleasant thing to hear him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">464</span>
gracefully narrating to the court circles the manner
in which he had escaped from the fort of Pizzighitone,
where he had been confined after the battle of Pavia.
‘In vain,’ he said, ‘did I offer the emperor a large
ransom; he was deaf. Determined to escape from my
gaolers, I bribed two of my guards; I procured a rope-ladder,
and Vivis and I&mdash;(Vivis was his page)&mdash;let
ourselves down from the window during the night.
My room was at a great height, situated in the main
tower above the moat. But, resolved to sacrifice my
life rather than the states of my fathers, I put on the
clothes of one of my attendants, who took my place in
my bed. I opened the window; it was a dark night;
I glided slowly down the high walls; I reached the
ground, crossed the ditches, quitted the castle of
Pavia, and, by God’s help, managed so well that I got
to St. Just on Christmas Eve’ (1525).<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">472</a></p>

<p>Henry d’Albret, having thus escaped from his enemies,
hastened to Lyons, where he found Madame,
and where Margaret arrived soon after, on her return
from Spain. Smitten with her beauty, wit, and grace,
the King of Navarre courted her hand. Everything
about him charmed all who saw him; but Margaret’s
hand was not easy to be obtained. She had been first
asked in marriage for the youthful Charles, King of
Spain; and such a union, if it had been carried out,
might not perhaps have been without influence upon the
destinies of Europe. But the age of the monarch (he
was then but eight years old) had caused the negotiation
to fail, and the sister of the King of France married
the Duke of Alen&ccedil;on, a prince of the blood, but a man
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">465</span>
without understanding, amiability, or courage. Chief
cause of the disasters of Pavia, he had fled from the
field of battle and died of shame.</p>

<p>Margaret did not at first accept the homage of the
young King of Navarre. She was not to find in him
all the support she needed; but that was not the only
motive of her refusal; she could not think of marriage
so long as her brother was a prisoner. Henry was not
discouraged; he did all he could to please the duchess,
and, knowing her attachment for the Gospel, he never
failed, when present in the council, to take up the defence
of the pious men whom Cardinal Duprat wished
to put to death. This intervention was not a mere idle
task. The persecution became such, that Margaret,
withdrawing from the attentions of the prince, thought
only of the dangers to which the humble christians
were exposed whose faith she shared.</p>

<p>We shall see that the pope and the Sorbonne had
more influence in France than the regent and the
king.

<h2 id="BOOK_II_CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.<br />

<span class="small">DEATH OF THE MARTYRS: RETURN OF THE KING.<br />

(1526.)</span></h2>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">At</span> the very moment when the duchess, the Count
of Hohenlohe, and others were indulging in
the sweetest hopes, the darkest future opened before
their eyes. Margaret had dreamt of a new day,
illumined by the brightest sunshine, but all of a sudden
the clouds gathered, the light was obscured, the
winds rose, and the tempest burst forth.</p>

<p>There was a young man, about twenty-eight years
of age, a licentiate of laws, William Joubert by
name, whom his father, king’s advocate at La Rochelle,
had sent to Paris to study the practice of the courts.
Notwithstanding the prohibition of the parliament,
William, who was of a serious disposition, ventured to
inquire into the catholic faith. Conceiving doubts about
it, he said in the presence of some friends, that ‘neither
Genevieve nor even Mary could save him, but the Son
of God alone.’ Shortly after the issuing of the proclamation,
the licentiate was thrown into prison. The
alarmed father immediately hurried to Paris: his son,
his hope ... a heretic! and on the point of being
burnt! He gave himself no rest: he went from one
judge to another: ‘Ask what you please,’ said the
unhappy father; ‘I am ready to give any money to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">467</span>
save his life.’<a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">473</a> Vainly did he repeat his entreaties
day after day; on Saturday, February 17, 1526, the
executioner came to fetch William; he helped him
to get into the tumbrel, and led him to the front of
Notre Dame: ‘Beg Our Lady’s pardon,’ he said. He
next took him to the front of St. Genevieve’s church:
‘Ask pardon of St. Genevieve.’ The Rocheller was
firm in his faith, and would ask pardon of none but
God. He was then taken to the Place Maubert, where
the people, seeing his youth and handsome appearance,
deeply commiserated his fate; but the tender souls
received but rough treatment from the guards. ‘Do
not pity him,’ they said; ‘he has spoken evil of Our
Lady and the saints in paradise, and holds to the
doctrine of Luther.’ The hangman then took up his
instruments, approached William, made him open his
mouth, and pierced his tongue. He then strangled
him and afterwards burnt his body. The poor father
returned alone to Rochelle. But the parliament was
not satisfied with one victim; erelong it made an
assault upon the inhabitants of a city which the
enemies of the Gospel detested in an especial manner.</p>

<p>A well-educated young man of Meaux had come to
Paris; he had translated ‘certain books’ from Latin into
French: he took Luther’s part and spoke out boldly:
‘We need not take holy water to wash away our sins,’
he said; ‘the blood of Christ alone can cleanse us from
them. We need not pray for the dead, for immediately
after death their souls are either in paradise or
in hell; there is no purgatory; I do not believe in it.’<a id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">474</a>
‘Ah!’ said the angry monks, ‘we see how it is; Meaux
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">468</span>
is thoroughly infected with false doctrine; one <i>Falry</i>,<a id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">475</a>
a priest, with some others, is the cause of these perversions.’
The young man was denounced to the
parliament. ‘If you do not recant, you will be burned,’
they said. The poor youth was terrified; he was
afraid of death. They led him to the front of the
cathedral of Notre Dame; there he mounted a ladder,
bareheaded, with lighted taper in his hand, and cried
out for: ‘Pardon of God and of Our Lady!’ Then the
priests put in his hands the books he had translated;
he read them ‘every word’ (the titles doubtless), and
afterwards pronounced them to be false and damnable.
The books were burnt before his face; and as for him,
‘he was taken to the Celestines’ prison and put upon
bread and water.’</p>

<p>He was not the only man of his native city who
had to make expiation for the zeal with which he had
received the Reform. A fuller, also a native of Meaux,
who followed like him the ‘sect of Luther,’ suffered a
similar punishment about the same time.<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">476</a> ‘This
Lutheran,’ said the burghers of Paris, ‘has the presumption
to say that the Virgin and the saints have
no power, and such like nonsense.’</p>

<p>Picardy next furnished its tribute. Picardy in the
north and Dauphiny in the south were the two provinces
of France best prepared to receive the Gospel. During
the fifteenth century many Picardins, as the story ran,
went to <i>Vaudery</i>. Seated round the fire during the long
nights, simple catholics used to tell one another how
these <i>Vaudois</i> (Waldenses) met in horrible assembly
in solitary places, where they found tables spread with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">469</span>
numerous and dainty viands. These poor christians
loved indeed to meet together from districts often very
remote. They went to the rendezvous by night and
along by-roads. The most learned of them used to recite
some passages of Scripture, after which they conversed
together and prayed. But such humble conventicles
were ridiculously travestied. ‘Do you know what
they do to get there,’ said the people, ‘so that the
officers may not stop them? The devil has given
them a certain ointment, and when they want to go
to <i>Vaudery</i>, they smear a little stick with it. As soon
as they get astride it, they are carried up through the
air, and arrive at their <i>sabbath</i> without meeting anybody.
In the midst of them sits a goat with a
monkey’s tail: this is Satan, who receives their adoration!’ ...
These stupid stories were not peculiar to
the people: they were circulated particularly by the
monks. It was thus that the inquisitor Jean de
Broussart spoke in 1460 from a pulpit erected in the
great square at Arras. An immense multitude surrounded
him; a scaffold was erected in front of the
pulpit, and a number of men and women, kneeling
and wearing caps with the figure of the devil painted
on them, awaited their punishment. Perhaps the
faith of these poor people was mingled with error.
But be that as it may, they were all burnt alive
after the sermon.<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">477</a></p>

<p>A young student, who already held a living, though
not yet in priest’s orders, had believed in the Gospel,
and had boldly declared that there was no other
saviour but Jesus Christ, and that the Virgin Mary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">470</span>
had no more power than other saints.<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">478</a> This youthful
cleric of Th&eacute;rouanne in Picardy had been imprisoned
in 1525, and terrified by the punishment. On Christmas-eve,
with a lighted torch in his hand and stripped
to his shirt, he had ‘asked pardon of God and of
Mary before the church of Notre Dame.’ In consideration
of his ‘very great penitence,’ it was thought
sufficient to confine him for seven years on bread and
water in the prison of St. Martin des Champs. Alone
in his dungeon, the scholar heard the voice of God in
the depths of his heart; he began to weep hot tears,
and ‘forthwith,’ says the chronicler, ‘he returned to
his folly.’ Whenever a monk entered his prison,
the young cleric proclaimed the Gospel to him; the
monks were astonished at such raving; all the convent
was in a ferment and confusion. Dr. Merlin, the
grand penitentiary, went to the prisoner in person,
preached to him, advised and entreated him, but all to
no effect. By order of the court, the young evangelist
‘was burnt at the Gr&egrave;ve in Paris,’ and others underwent
the same punishment. Such was the method
employed in that cruel age to force the doctrine of the
Church back into the hearts of those who rejected it:
they made use of scourges to beat them, and cords to
strangle them.</p>

<p>It was not only in Paris that severity was used
against the Lutherans: the same was done in the
provinces. Young Pierre Toussaint, prebendary of
Metz, who had taken refuge at Basle after the death
of Leclerc,<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">479</a> having regained his courage, returned to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">471</span>
France and proclaimed the Gospel. His enemies
seized him, and gave him up to the Abbot of St.
Antoine. This abbot, a well-known character, was
a violent, cruel, and merciless man.<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">480</a> Neither Toussaint’s
youth, nor his candour, nor his weak health
could touch him; he threw his victim into a horrible
dungeon full of stagnant water and other filth,<a id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">481</a> where
the young evangelist could hardly stand. With his
back against the wall, and his feet on the only spot in
the dungeon which the water did not reach, stifled by
the poisonous vapours emitted around him, the young
man remembered the cheerful house of his uncle the
Dean of Metz and the magnificent palace of the Cardinal
of Lorraine, where he had been received so
kindly while he still believed in the pope. What a
contrast now! Toussaint’s health declined, his cheeks
grew pale, and his trembling legs could hardly support
him. Alas! where were those days when still a
child he ran joyously round the room riding on a
stick,<a id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">482</a> and when his mother seriously uttered this
prophecy: ‘Antichrist will soon come and destroy all
who are converted.’ The wretched Toussaint thought
the moment had arrived.... His imagination became
excited, he fancied he saw the terrible antichrist foretold
by his mother, seizing him and dragging him to
punishment; he screamed aloud, and was near dying
of fright.<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">483</a> He interested every one who saw him; he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">472</span>
was so mild; harmless as a new-born child, they said,
so that the cruel abbot knew not how to justify his
death. He thought that if he had Toussaint’s books
and papers, he could find an excuse for burning him.
One day the monks came to the wretched young man,
took him out of the unwholesome pit, and led him
into the abbot’s room. ‘Write to your host at
Basle,’ said the latter; ‘tell him that you want your
books to amuse your leisure, and beg him to send
them to you.’ Toussaint, who understood the meaning
of this order, hesitated. The abbot gave utterance
to terrible threats. The affrighted Toussaint wrote
the letter, and was sent back to his pestilential den.</p>

<p>Thus the very moment when the evangelical christians
were hoping to have some relief was marked by
an increase of severity. The Reform&mdash;Margaret
was its representative at that time in the eyes of
many&mdash;the afflicted Reform saw her children around
her, some put to death, others in chains, all threatened
with the fatal blow. The sister of Francis I., heartbroken
and despairing, would have shielded with her
body those whom the sword appeared ready to strike;
but her exertions seemed useless.</p>

<p>Suddenly a cry of joy was heard, which, uttered
in the Pyrenees, was reechoed even to Calais. The
<i>Sun</i> (for thus, it will be remembered, Margaret called
her brother) appeared in the south to reanimate the
kingdom of France. On the 21st of March Francis
quitted Spain, crossed the Bidassoa, and once more set
his foot on French ground. He had recovered his
spirits; an overflowing current of life had returned to
every part of his existence. It seemed that, delivered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">473</span>
from a prison, he was the master of the world. He
mounted an Arab horse, and, waving his cap and
plume in the air, exclaimed as he galloped along the
road to St. Jean de Luz: ‘Once more I am a king!’
Thence he proceeded to Bayonne, where his court
awaited him, with a great number of his subjects
who had not been permitted to approach nearer to
the frontier.</p>

<p>Nowhere was the joy so great as with Margaret and
the friends of the Gospel. Some of them determined
to go and meet the king and petition him on behalf
of the exiles and the prisoners, feeling persuaded that
he would put himself at the head of the party which
the detested Charles V. was persecuting. These <i>most
pious Gauls</i>, as Zwingle calls them,<a id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">484</a> petitioned the
monarch; Margaret uttered a cry in favour of the
miserable;<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">485</a> but Francis, though full of regard for his
sister, could not hide a secret irritation against Luther
and the Lutherans. His profane character, his sensual
temperament, made him hate the evangelicals, and
policy demanded great reserve.</p>

<p>Margaret had never ceased to entertain in her
heart a hope of seeing the Count of Hohenlohe come
to Paris and labour at spreading the Gospel in France.
Sigismond, a man of the world and at the same time
a man of God, an evangelical christian and yet a
church dignitary, knowing Germany well, and considered
at the court of France as belonging to it,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">474</span>
appeared to the Duchess of Alen&ccedil;on the fittest instrument
to work among the French that transformation
equally demanded by the wants of the age and the
Word of God. One day she took courage and presented
her request to her brother: Francis did not
receive her petition favourably. He knew Hohenlohe
well, and thought his evangelical principles
exaggerated; besides, if any change were to be made
in France, the king meant to carry it out alone. He
did not, however, open his heart entirely to his sister:
he simply gave her to understand that the time was
not yet come. If the count came to Paris; if he
gathered round him all the friends of the Gospel; if
he preached at court, in the churches, in the open air
perhaps, what would the emperor say, and what the
pope?&mdash;‘Not yet,’ said the king.</p>

<p>The Duchess of Alen&ccedil;on, bitterly disappointed,
could hardly make up her mind to communicate this
sad news to the count. Yet it must be done. ‘The
desire I have to see you is increased by what I hear
of your virtue and of the perseverance of the divine
grace in you. But ... my dear cousin, all your
friends have arrived at the conclusion that, <i>for certain
reasons</i>, it is not yet time for you to come here. As
soon as we have <i>done something</i>, with God’s grace, I will
let you know.’</p>

<p>Hohenlohe was distressed at this delay, and Margaret
endeavoured to comfort him. ‘Erelong,’ she
said, ‘the Almighty will do us the grace to perfect
what he has done us the grace to <i>begin</i>. You will
then be consoled in this company, where you are
<i>present</i> though <i>absent</i> in body. May the peace of our
Lord, which passeth all understanding, and which the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">475</span>
world knoweth not, be given to your heart so abundantly
that no cross can afflict it!’<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">486</a></p>

<p>At the same time she increased her importunity
with her brother; she conjured the king to inaugurate
a new era; she once more urged the propriety of
inviting the count. ‘I do not care for that man,’
answered Francis sharply. He cared for him, however,
when he wanted him. There is a letter from
the king ‘to his very dear and beloved cousin of
Hohenlohe,’ in which he tells him that, desiring
to raise a large army, and knowing ‘his loyalty and
valour, his nearness of lineage, love, and charity,’ he
begs him most affectionately to raise three thousand
foot-soldiers.<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">487</a> But where the Gospel was concerned,
it was quite another matter. To put an end to his
sister’s solicitation, Francis replied to her one day:
‘Do you wish, then, for my sons to remain in Spain?’
He had given them as hostages to the emperor. Margaret
was silent: she had not a word to say where the
fate of her nephews was concerned. She wrote to the
count: ‘I cannot tell you, my friend, all the vexation
I suffer: <i>the king would not see you willingly</i>; the reason
is the liberation of his children, which he cares for
quite as much as for his own.’ She added: ‘I am of
good courage towards you, rather on account of our
fraternal affection than by the perishable ties of flesh
and blood. For the <i>other</i> birth, the <i>second</i> delivery&mdash;there
lies true and perfect union.’ The Count of
Hohenlohe, Luther’s disciple, did not come to France.</p>

<p>This refusal was not the only grief which Francis
caused his sister. The love of the King of Navarre
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">476</span>
had grown stronger, and she began to return it. But
the king opposed her following the inclination of her
heart. Margaret, thwarted in all her wishes, drinking
of the bitter cup, revolting sometimes against the
despotic will to which she was forced to bend, and
feeling the wounds of sin in her heart, retired to her
closet and laid bare her sorrows to Christ.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The religious poems of Margaret, which are deficient
neither in grace, sensibility, nor affection, belong (it
must not be forgotten) to the early productions of
the French muse; and what particularly leads us to
quote them is that they express the christian sentiments
of this princess. This is the period at which
it seems to us that Margaret’s christianity was purest.
At an earlier date, at the time of her connection with
Bri&ccedil;onnet, her faith was clouded with the vapours of
mysticism. At a later date, when the fierce will of
Francis I. alarmed her tender and shrinking soul,
a veil of catholicism appeared to cover the purity of
her faith. But from 1526 to 1532 Margaret was
herself. The evidences of the piety of the evangelical
christians of this period are so few, that we could not
permit ourselves to suppress those we find in the
writings of the king’s sister.</p>

<p>The Duchess of Alen&ccedil;on resorted to poetry to divert
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">477</span>
her thoughts; and it was now, I think, that she wrote
her poem of the <i>Prisoner</i>. She loved to recall the time
when the King of Navarre had been captured along
with Francis I.; she transported herself to the days
immediately following the battle of Pavia; she imagined
she could hear young Henry d’Albret expressing
his confidence in God, and exclaiming from the lofty
tower of Pizzighitone:

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Vainly the winds o’er the ocean blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scattering the ships as they proudly go;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But not a leaf of the wood can they shake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until at the sound of thy voice they awake.<br /></span>
</span></span>

The captive, after describing in a mournful strain the
sorrows of his prison, laid before Christ the sorrow
which sprang from a feeling of his sins:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Not <i>one</i> hell but many million<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I’ve deserved for my rebellion.<br /></span>
<span style="letter-spacing: 1em" class="i0"> * * * * * <br /></span>
<span class="i0">But my sin in thee was scourged,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And my guilt in thee was purged.<a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">489</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The noble prisoner does not seek the salvation of
God for himself alone; he earnestly desires that the
Gospel may be brought to that Italy where he is a
captive&mdash;one of the earliest aspirations for Italian
reformation.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Can you tell why from your home&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Home so peaceful&mdash;you were torn?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Twas that over stream and mountain<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The precious treasure should be borne<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By thee, in thy vessel frail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To God’s elect<a id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">490</a> ....<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">478</span>
</div></div>

<p>On a sudden the prisoner remembers his friend; he
believes in his tender commiseration and thus invokes
him:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O Francis, my king, of my soul the best part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou model of friendship, so dear to my heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Jonathan, Orestes, and Pollux in one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As thou seest me in sorrow and anguish cast down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My Achates, my brother, oh! what sayest thou?<a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">491</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But Henry d’Albret called Francis I. his Jonathan
to no purpose; Jonathan would not give him his
sister. The king had other thoughts. During his
captivity the emperor had demanded Margaret’s hand
of the regent.<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">492</a> But Francis, whom they were going
to unite, contrary to his wishes, to Charles’s sister,
thought that one marriage with the house of Austria
was enough, and hoping that Henry VIII. might aid
him in taking vengeance on Charles, was seized with
a strong liking for him. ‘If my body is the emperor’s
prisoner,’ he said, ‘my heart is a prisoner to
the King of England!’<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">493</a> He gained over Cardinal
Wolsey, who told his master that there was not in all
Europe a woman worthier of the crown of England
than Margaret of France.<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">494</a> But the christian heart
of the Duchess of Alen&ccedil;on revolted at the idea of
taking the place of Catherine of Arragon, whose virtues
she honoured;<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">495</a> and Henry VIII. himself soon entered
on a different course. It was necessary to give
up the design of placing Margaret on the throne of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">479</span>
England by the side of Henry Tudor ... a fortunate
thing for the princess, but a misfortune perhaps for
the kingdom over which she would have reigned.</p>

<p>Yet the Duchess of Alen&ccedil;on did not see all her
prayers refused. On leaving his prison, the sight of
Francis I. was confused. By degrees he saw more
clearly into the state of things in Europe, and took a
few steps towards that religious liberty which Margaret
had so ardently desired of him. It would even
seem that, guided by his sister, he rose to considerations
of a loftier range.

<h2 id="BOOK_II_CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.<br />

<span class="small">DELIVERY OF THE CAPTIVES AND RETURN OF THE EXILES.<br />

(1526.)</span></h2>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">There</span> was an instinctive feeling in christendom
that up to this time its society had been but
fragmentary, a great disorder, an immense chaos.<a id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">496</a>
It felt an earnest want of that social unity, of that
supreme order, and of that all-ruling idea which the
papacy had not been able to give. By proclaiming a
new creation, the Reformation was about to accomplish
this task. The isolation of nations was to cease;
all would touch each other; reciprocal influences
would multiply from generation to generation....
The Reformation prepared the way for the great
unity in the midst of the world.</p>

<p>Evangelical christians felt a consciousness, indistinct
perhaps, though deep, of this new movement in human
affairs, and many would have wished that France
should not yield to Germany or England the privilege
of marching in the van of the new order of things.
They said that since the emperor had put himself at
the head of the enemies of the Reformation, the king
ought to place himself in the front rank of its defenders.
The Duchess of Alen&ccedil;on in particular was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">481</span>
constantly soliciting the king, and praying him to
recall to France the men who would bring into it
the true light. But Francis received her proposals
coldly, sometimes rudely, and cut short every attempt
to answer; still the duchess was indefatigable,
and when the king shut the door against her, ‘she got
in through the keyhole.’ At last Francis, who loved
his sister, esteemed learning, and despised the monks,
yielded to her pressing entreaties, and above all to
the new ideas and the exigencies of his political plans.
The gates of the prisons were opened.</p>

<p>Berquin was still a prisoner, sorrowful but comforted
by his faith, unable to see clearly into the
future, but immovable in his loyalty to the Gospel.
The king determined to save him from ‘the claws of
Beda’s faction.’ ‘I will not suffer the person or the
goods of this gentleman to be injured,’ he said to the
parliament on the 1st of April; ‘I will inquire into
the matter myself.’ The officers sent by the king
took the christian captive from his prison, and, though
still keeping watch over him, placed him in a commodious
chamber. Berquin immediately set about
forming plans for the triumph of truth.</p>

<p>Clement Marot had paid dearly for the privilege of
being Margaret’s secretary; he was in prison, and consoled
himself by composing his little poems. Margaret
obtained his full release, and Marot hastened to
his friends, exclaiming in a transport of joy:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In narrow cell without a cause,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shut up in foul despite of laws<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By wicked men, the king’s decree<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In this New Year has set me free.<a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">497</a><br /></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">482</span>
</div></div>

<p>Michael of Aranda, who, in 1524, had preached the
Gospel with such power at Lyons, had been removed
from Margaret, whose almoner he was. She sent for
him and imparted to him her plan for introducing the
Gospel into the Catholic Church of France, by renewing
without destroying it. ‘I have procured your
nomination to the bishopric of Trois-Ch&acirc;teaux in
Dauphiny,’<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">498</a> she said. ‘Go, and evangelise your
diocese.’ He accepted; the truth had already been
scattered in Dauphiny by Farel and others. Did
Aranda share Margaret’s views, or had ambition
anything to do with his acceptance? It is hard
to say.</p>

<p>A fourth victim of the persecution was soon saved.
The young prebendary of Metz, the amiable Pierre
Toussaint, was still in the frightful den into which the
abbot of St. Antoine had thrust him. His host at
Basle had not sent the books which the treacherous
priest had constrained him to write for; no doubt
the worthy citizen, knowing in whose hands his
friend was lying, had foreseen the danger to which
their receipt would expose him. Several evangelical
christians of France, Switzerland, and Lorraine, particularly
the merchant Vaugris, had successively
interceded in his favour, but to no purpose. Finding
all their exertions useless, they applied at last
to Margaret, who warmly pleaded the cause of the
young evangelist before the king. In July 1526,
the order for his release arrived. The officers charged
with this pleasing task descended to the gloomy dungeon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">483</span>
selected by the abbot of St. Antoine, and
rescued the lamb from the fangs of that wild beast.
Toussaint, thin, weak, pale as a faded flower, came
out slowly from his fearful den. His weakened eyes
could hardly support the light of day, and he knew
not where to go. At first he went to some old acquaintances;
but they were all afraid of harbouring a
heretic escaped from the scaffold. The young prebendary
did not possess Berquin’s energy; he was
one of those sensitive and delicate natures that need
a support, and he found himself in the world, in the
free air, almost as much alone as in his dungeon.
‘Ah!’ he said, ‘God our heavenly Father, who has
fixed bounds to the wrath of man which it cannot
pass, has delivered me in a wonderful manner from
the hands of the tyrants; but, alas! what will become
of me? The world is mad and spurns the rising
Gospel of Jesus Christ.’<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">499</a> A few timid but well-meaning
friends said to him: ‘The Duchess of
Alen&ccedil;on alone can protect you; there is no asylum
for you but at her court. Make application to a
princess who welcomes with so much generosity all
the friends of learning and of the Gospel, and profit
by your residence to investigate closely the wind that
blows in those elevated regions.’ Toussaint did
what they told him; he began his journey, and, despite
his natural timidity, arrived at Paris, where we
shall meet with him again.</p>

<p>More important deliverances still were in preparation.
Strasburg was to rejoice. There was no city
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">484</span>
out of France where the king’s return had been hailed
with so much enthusiasm. Many evangelical christians
had sought refuge there from the cruelties of
Duprat, and were sighing for the moment that would
restore them to their country. Among the number of
the refugees was the famous Cornelius Agrippa. His
reputation was not unblemished; a book on the
‘Vanity of Science’ does him little credit; but he
seems at this time to have been occupied with the
Gospel. Having received a letter from the excellent
Papillon, who told him how favourable the king
appeared to the new light, Agrippa, who, surrounded
by pious men, took their tone and tuned his voice in
harmony with theirs, exclaimed: ‘All the Church of
the saints with us, hearing of the triumphs of the
Word at the court and in the most part of France,
rejoiced with exceeding great joy.<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">500</a> I bless the Lord
for the glory with which the Word is crowned among
you. Would to God that we were permitted, as well
as you, to return to France!’ Another country was
equally attractive to this scholar: ‘Write to me what
they are doing at Geneva ... tell me if the Word is
loved there, and if they care for learning.’<a id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">501</a></p>

<p>Men more decided than Cornelius Agrippa were
to be found at Strasburg. During all the winter the
hospitable house of Capito had often witnessed the
meetings of those christians who had raised highest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">485</span>
the standard of the Gospel in France. There assembled
the aged Lef&egrave;vre, the first translator of the Bible,
who had escaped the stake only by flight; the pious
Roussel, Vedastes, Simon, and Farel who had arrived
from Montb&eacute;liard. These friends of the Reformation
concealed themselves under assumed names: Lef&egrave;vre
passed as Anthony Peregrin; Roussel as Tolnin; but
they were known by everybody, even by the children
in the streets.<a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">502</a> They often met Bucer, Zell, and the
Count of Hohenlohe, and edified one another. Margaret
undertook to bring them all back to France. The
court was then in the south; the king was at Cognac,
his birthplace, where he often resided; the duchesses
(his mother and sister) at Angoul&ecirc;me. One day
when they met, Margaret entreated her brother to
put an end to the cruel exile of her friends: Francis
granted everything.</p>

<p>What joy! the aged Lef&egrave;vre, the fervent Roussel,
are recalled <i>with honour</i>, says Erasmus.<a id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">503</a> The Strasburgers
embraced them with tears; the old man
felt happy that he was going to die in the country
where he was born. He immediately took the road
to France in company with Roussel; others followed
them; all believed that the new times were come.
In their meetings the evangelicals called to mind these
words of the prophet: <i>The ransomed of the Lord shall
return and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy
upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness,
and sorrow and sighing shall flee away</i>.<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">504</a> Lef&egrave;vre and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">486</span>
Roussel hastened to their protectress. Margaret received
them kindly, lodged them in the castle of Angoul&ecirc;me,
where she was born, on that smiling hill
which she loved so much, near that ‘softly-flowing’
Charente, as she describes it. Lef&egrave;vre and Roussel
had many precious conversations with her. They
loved to speak of their life at Strasburg, of the new
views they had found there, and of the brotherly communion
they had enjoyed. ‘We were there,’ they
said, ‘with William Farel, Michael of Aranda, Francis
Lambert, John Vedastes, the Chevalier d’Esch, and
many other evangelicals ... scattered members of a
torn body, but one in Christ Jesus. We carefully
put out of sight all that might interrupt the harmony
between brethren; the peace that we tasted, far from
being without savour, like that of the world, was perfumed
with the sweet odour of God’s service.’</p>

<p>This meeting at Strasburg had borne fruit. The
energetic Farel, the learned Lef&egrave;vre, the spiritual
Roussel, gifted with such opposite natures, had reacted
upon each other. Farel had become more gentle,
Roussel more strong; contact with iron had given
an unusual hardness to a metal by nature inclined
to be soft. The sermons they heard, their frequent
conversations, the trials of exile, and the consolation of
the Spirit of God, had tempered the souls which had
been not a little discouraged by persecution. Roussel
had taken advantage of his leisure to study Hebrew,
and the Word of God had acquired a sovereign importance
in his eyes. Struck by the virtues of which
the early christians had given an example, he had found
that we must seek for the secret of their lives in the
history of the primitive Church, in the inspired Scripture
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">487</span>
of God. ‘The purity of religion will never be
restored,’ he used to say, ‘unless we drink at the
springs which the Holy Ghost has given us.’<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">505</a></p>

<p>It was not enough for the refugees to have returned;
their christian activity must be employed to the advantage
of France. At the beginning of June, Roussel
went to Blois. Margaret wished to make this city&mdash;the
favourite residence of the Valois, and notorious for
the crimes perpetrated there in after years&mdash;a refuge
for the persecuted, a caravanserai for the saints, a
stronghold of the Gospel. On the 29th of June
Lef&egrave;vre also went there.<a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">506</a> The king intrusted him
with the education of his third son and the care of the
castle library. Chapelain, physician to the Duchess of
Angoul&ecirc;me, and Cop, another doctor, of whom we shall
see more hereafter, were also in that city; and all of
them, filled with gratitude towards Francis I., were
contriving the means of imparting ‘something of Christianity
to the Most Christian King’<a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">507</a>&mdash;which was, in
truth, very necessary.</p>

<p>Thus things were advancing. It seemed as if learning
and the Gospel had returned with the king from
banishment. Macrin, whose name Zwingle placed side
by side with that of Berquin, was set at liberty.<a id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">508</a>
Cornelius Agrippa returned to Lyons. Sprung from
an ancient family of Cologne, he had served seven years
in the imperial army; he then became a great <i>savant</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">488</span>
(and not a great magician, as was supposed), doctor of
theology, law, and medicine. He published a book on
Marriage and against celibacy, which excited much
clamour. Agrippa was astonished at this, and not
without reason. ‘What!’ he exclaimed, ‘the tales of
Boccaccio, the jests of Poggio, the adulteries of Euryalus
and Lucretia, the loves of Tristan and of Lancelot,
are read greedily, even by young girls<a id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">509</a> ... and yet
they cry out against my book on Marriage!’&mdash;This
explains an incident in history: the youthful readers
of Boccaccio became the famous ‘squadron’ of Catherine
de’ Medici, by whose means that impure woman
obtained so many victories over the lords of the court.</p>

<p>When men heard of these deliverances, they thought
that Francis I., seeing Charles V. at the head of the
Roman party, would certainly put himself at the head
of the evangelical cause, and that the two champions
would decide on the battle-field the great controversy
of the age. ‘The king,’ wrote the excellent Capito
to the energetic Zwingle, ‘is favourable to the Word
of God.’<a id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">510</a> Margaret already saw the Holy Ghost
reviving in France the <i>one</i>, <i>holy</i>, and <i>universal Church</i>.
She resolved to hasten on these happy times, and,
leaving Angoul&ecirc;me and Blois in the month of July,
arrived in Paris.</p>

<p>Toussaint was waiting for her. Having reached the
capital under an assumed name, the young evangelist at
first kept himself in concealment. On hearing of the
arrival of the sister of Francis, he asked permission to
see her in private; and the princess, as was her custom,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">489</span>
received him with great kindness. What a contrast for
this poor man, just rescued from the cruel talons of the
abbot of St. Antoine, to find himself in the palace of
St. Germain, where Margaret’s person, her urbanity,
wit, lively piety, indefatigable zeal, love of letters, and
elegance, charmed all who came near her! Toussaint,
like the poet, was never tired of admiring</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A sweetness living in her beauteous face<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which does the fairest of her sex eclipse,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A lively wit, of learning ample store,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And over all a captivating grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whether she speaks, or silent are her lips.<a id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">511</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>One thing, however, charmed Toussaint still more:
it was the true piety which he found in Margaret.
She treated him with the kindness of a christian
woman, and soon put him at his ease. ‘The most
illustrious Duchess of Alen&ccedil;on,’ he wrote, ‘has received
me with as much kindness as if I had been a prince or
the person who was dearest to her.<a id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">512</a> I hope,’ he added,
‘that the Gospel of Christ will soon reign in France.’<a id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">513</a>
The duchess, on her part, touched with the faith of the
young evangelist, invited him to come again and see
her the next day. He went and he went again; he
had long and frequent conversations with Margaret
on the means of propagating the Gospel everywhere.<a id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">514</a>
‘God, by the light of his Word,’ he said, ‘must illumine
the world, and by the breath of his Spirit must
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">490</span>
transform all hearts. The Gospel alone, Madame,
will bring into regular order all that is confused.’&mdash;‘It
is the only thing that I desire,’ replied Margaret.<a id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">515</a>
She believed in the victory of truth; it seemed to her
that the men of light could not be conquered by the
men of darkness. The new life was about to rise like
the tide, and erelong cover with its wide waves the
arid <i>landes</i> of France. Margaret espied tongues
of fire, she heard eloquent voices, she felt swelling
hearts throbbing around her. Everything was
stirring in that new and mysterious world which
enraptured her imagination. It was to inaugurate
this new era, so full of light, of faith, of liberty, that
her brother had been delivered from the prisons of
Charles V. ‘Ah!’ she said to Toussaint in their
evangelical conversations, ‘it is not only myself that
desires the triumph of the Gospel; even the king
wishes for it.<a id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">516</a> And, believe me, our mother
(Louisa of Savoy!) will not oppose our efforts.<a id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">517</a> The
king,’ she protested to the young man, ‘is coming to
Paris to secure the progress of the Gospel&mdash;if, at least,
the war does not prevent him.’<a id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">518</a> Noble illusions!
Certain ideas on this subject, in accord with his
policy, were running, no doubt, in the king’s mind;
but at that time Francis was thinking of nothing but
compensating himself for the privations of captivity
by indulging in gallantry.</p>

<p>The young prebendary of Metz was under the spell;
he indulged in the greatest hopes, and joyfully hailed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">491</span>
the new firmament in which Margaret would shine as
one of the brightest stars. He wrote to Œcolampadius:
‘This illustrious princess is so taught of God, and so
familiar with Holy Scripture, that no one can ever
separate her from Jesus Christ.’<a id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">519</a> Some have asked
whether this prediction was verified. Margaret of
Navarre, terrified by her brother’s threats, certainly
made a lamentable concession in after years, and this
is proved by a letter Calvin addressed to her; but she
was, nevertheless, a tree planted by the rivers of water.
The storm broke off a few branches; still the roots
were deep, and the tree did not perish.</p>

<p>Toussaint often found the halls of the palace of
St. Germain filled with the most distinguished personages
of the kingdom, eager to present their homage
to the sister of Francis I. Side by side with ambassadors
and nobles dressed in the most costly garments,
and soldiers with their glittering arms, were cardinals
robed in scarlet and ermine, bishops with their satin
copes, ecclesiastics of every order, with long gowns
and tonsured heads.<a id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">520</a> These clerics, all desirous
of attaining to the highest offices of the Church, approached
the illustrious princess, spoke to her of the
Gospel, of Christ, of <i>inextinguishable love</i>; and Toussaint
listened with astonishment to such strange court language.
His former patron, the Cardinal of Lorraine,
archbishop of Rheims and of Lyons, whom we must not
confound with his infamous nephew, one of the butchers
of the St. Bartholomew massacre, gave the young prebendary
a most affable reception, never ceasing to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">492</span>
repeat that he loved the Gospel extremely.... Margaret,
who permitted herself to be easily persuaded,
took the religious prattle of this troop of flatterers for
sound piety, and inspired the young christian with
her own blind confidence.</p>

<p>Yet the latter sometimes asked himself whether all
these fine speeches were not mere court compliments.
One day he heard Bri&ccedil;onnet, Bishop of Meaux, in
whom the most credulous still placed some hope, rank
the Roman Church very high and the Word of God
very low: ‘Hypocritical priest!’ said Toussaint aside,
‘you desire more to please men than to please God!’
If these sycophant priests chanced to meet with any
noble scoffers or atheists, in some apartment far from
that of the princess or on the terrace of St. Germain, they
fearlessly threw aside the mask, and turned into ridicule
the evangelical faith they had cried up before the
sister of Francis I. When they had obtained the benefices
they coveted, they changed sides; they were the
foremost in attacking the Lutherans;<a id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">521</a> and if they
observed any evangelicals coming, they turned their
backs upon them. Then would Toussaint exclaim:
‘Alas! they speak well of Jesus Christ with those who
speak well of him; but with those who blaspheme,
they blaspheme also.’<a id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">522</a></p>

<p>Lef&egrave;vre and Roussel having come to Paris from
Blois, about the end of July 1526, the young and
impetuous Toussaint, full of respect for them, hastened
to tell them of his vexations, and demanded that they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">493</span>
should unmask these hypocrites and boldly preach the
Gospel in the midst of that perverse court. ‘Patience,’
said the two scholars, both rather temporising in disposition,
and whom the air of the court had perhaps
already weakened, ‘patience! do not let us spoil anything;
the time is not yet come.’<a id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">523</a> Then Toussaint,
upright, generous, and full of affection, burst into
tears. ‘I cannot restrain my tears,’ he said.<a id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">524</a> ‘Yes;
be wise after your fashion; wait, put off, dissemble
as much as you please; you will acknowledge,
however, at last, that it is impossible to preach the
Gospel without bearing the cross.<a id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">525</a> The banner of
divine mercy is now raised, the gate of the kingdom
of heaven is open. God does not mean us to receive
his summons with supineness. We must make haste,
for fear the opportunity should escape us and the door
be shut.’</p>

<p>Toussaint, grieved and oppressed by the tone of
the court, told all his sorrows to the reformer of
Basle: ‘Dear Œcolampadius,’ he said, ‘when I think
that the king and the duchess are as well disposed as
possible to promote the Gospel of Christ, and when I
see at the same time those who are called to labour
the foremost at this excellent work having continual
recourse to delay, I cannot restrain my grief. What
would not you do in Germany, if the emperor and his
brother Ferdinand looked favourably on your efforts?’
Toussaint did not hide from Margaret herself how his
hopes had been disappointed. ‘Lef&egrave;vre,’ he said, ‘is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">494</span>
wanting in courage; may God strengthen and support
him!’ The duchess did all she could to keep the
young evangelist at her court; she sought for men
who, while having a christian heart and a christian
life, would not, however, break with the Church; she
accordingly offered the ex-prebendary great advantages,
but begging him at the same time to be moderate.
Toussaint, a man of susceptible and somewhat
hard character, haughtily repelled these advances.
He was stifled at the court; the air he breathed there
made him sick; admiration had yielded to disgust.
‘I despise these magnificent offers,’ he said, ‘I detest
the court more than any one has done.<a id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">526</a> Farewell to
the court ... it is the most dangerous of harlots.’<a id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">527</a>
Margaret conjured him at least not to quit France,
and sent him to one of her friends, Madame de Contraigues,
who, abounding in charity for the persecuted
evangelists, received them in her chateau of Malesherbes
in the Orl&eacute;anais. Before leaving, the young
Metzer, foreseeing that a terrible struggle was approaching,
recommended the friends he left behind
him to pray to God that France would show herself
worthy of the Word.<a id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">528</a> He then departed, praying
the Lord to send to this people the teacher, the
apostle, who, being himself a model of truth and devotedness,
would lead it in the new paths of life.

<h2 id="BOOK_II_CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br />

<span class="small">WHO WILL BE THE REFORMER OF FRANCE?<br />

(1526.)</span></h2>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Many</span> evangelical christians thought as Toussaint
did. They felt that France had need of a reformer,
but could see no one who answered to their
ideal. A man of God was wanted, who, possessing
the fundamental truths of the Gospel, could set them
forth in their living harmony; who, while exalting
the divine essence of Christianity, could present it in
its relations to human nature; who was fitted not only
to establish sound doctrine, but also by God’s grace to
shed abroad a new life in the Church; a servant of
God, full of courage, full of activity, as skilful in
governing as in leading. A Paul was wanted, but
where could he be found?</p>

<p>Would it be Lef&egrave;vre? He had taught plainly the
doctrine of justification by faith, even before Luther;
this we have stated elsewhere,<a id="FNanchor_529" href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">529</a> and many have repeated
it since. It is a truth gained to history.
But Lef&egrave;vre was old and courted repose; pious but
timid, a scholar of the closet rather than the reformer
of a people.</p>

<p>Would it be Roussel? Possessing an impressionable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">496</span>
and wavering heart, he longed for the good, but
did not always dare to do it. He preached frequently
at the duchess’s court before the most distinguished
men of the kingdom; but he did not proclaim the
whole counsel of God. He knew it, he was angry
with himself, and yet he was continually falling into
the same error. ‘Alas!’ he wrote to Farel, ‘there
are many evangelical truths one half of which I am
obliged to conceal. If the Lord does not rekindle
my zeal by his presence, I shall be very inferior to
what I ought to be.’<a id="FNanchor_530" href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">530</a> The pious but weak Roussel
was just the man the duchess required&mdash;fitted to
advance christian life without touching the institutions
of the Church. Sometimes, however, dissatisfied
with his position, and longing to preach the Gospel
without any respect to persons, he wished to go to
Italy ... and then he fell again into temporising.<a id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">531</a></p>

<p>The most decided christians saw his incompetence.
In their eyes the men round the Duchess of Alen&ccedil;on
who stopped halfway were incapable of reforming
France. It needed, they thought, a man of simple
soul, intrepid heart, and powerful eloquence, who,
walking with a firm foot, would give a new impulse
to the work too feebly commenced by Lef&egrave;vre and his
friends; and then these christians, going to the other
extreme, thought of Farel. At that time this reformer
was the greatest light of France. What love
he had for Jesus Christ! What eloquence in preaching!
What boldness in pressing onwards and surmounting
obstacles! What perseverance in the midst
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_497">497</span>
of dangers! But neither Francis nor Margaret would
have anything to do with him: they were afraid of
him. When the king recalled the other exiles, Farel
was left behind. He was then at Strasburg with one
foot on the frontier, waiting the order for his return,
but the order did not come. The court had no taste
for his aggressive preaching and his heroic firmness;
they wished for a softened and a perfumed Gospel in
France. The noble Dauphinese, when he saw all his
friends returning to their country while he remained
alone in exile, was overwhelmed with sorrow and cried
to God in his distress.</p>

<p>Roussel understood Margaret’s fears; Farel, he
knew, was not a courtier, and would never agree
with the duchess. Yet, knowing the value of such a
servant of God, the noble and pious Roussel tried
whether they could not profit in some other way by
his great activity, and if there was not some province
that could be opened to his mighty labours. ‘I will
obtain the means of providing for all your wants,’ he
wrote to him on the 27th of August from the castle of
Amboise, ‘until the Lord gives you at last an entrance
and brings you to us.’<a id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">532</a> That was also Farel’s
earnest desire; he was not then thinking of Switzerland;
his country possessed all his love; his eyes were
turned night and day towards those gates of France
so obstinately closed against him; he went up to them
and knocked. They still remained shut, and returning
disheartened he exclaimed: ‘Oh! if the Lord
would but open a way for me to return and labour
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_498">498</span>
in France!’ On a sudden the dearest of his wishes
seemed about to be realised.</p>

<p>One day, when there was a grand reception at
court, the two sons of Prince Robert de la Marche
came to pay their respects to the king’s sister. Since
the eighth century La Marche had formed a principality,
which afterwards became an appanage of the
Armagnacs and Bourbons.<a id="FNanchor_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">533</a> The Gospel had found
its way there. Margaret, who possessed in a high
degree the spirit of proselytism, said to Roussel, indicating
with her eyes those whose conversion she
desired: ‘Speak to those two young princes; seize, I
pray, this opportunity of advancing the cause of Jesus
Christ.’&mdash;‘I will do so,’ replied the chaplain eagerly.
Approaching the young noblemen, Roussel began
to converse about the Gospel. De Saucy and De
Giminetz (for such were their names) showed no
signs of astonishment, but listened with the liveliest
interest. The evangelist grew bolder, and explained
his wishes to them freely.<a id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">534</a> ‘It is not for yourselves
alone,’ he said, ‘that God has given you life,
but for the good of the members of Jesus Christ. It
is not enough for you to embrace Christ as your Saviour;
you must communicate the same grace to your
subjects.’<a id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">535</a> Roussel warmed at the idea of seeing
the Gospel preached among the green pastures which
the Vienne, the Creuse, and the Cher bathe with their
waters; through Gu&eacute;ret, Bellac, and the ancient territory
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">499</span>
of the Lemovices and Bituriges. The two
young princes on their part listened attentively to
the reformer, and gave the fullest assent to his words.<a id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">536</a>
Margaret’s chaplain made another step; he thought
he had found what he was seeking for the zealous
Farel; and when the sons of Robert de la Marche
told him they felt too weak for the task set before
them, he said: ‘I know but one man fitted for such
a great work; it is William Farel; Christ has given
him an extraordinary talent for making known the
riches of his glory. Invite him.’ The proposition
delighted the young princes. ‘We desire it still more
than you,’ they said; ‘our father and we will open our
arms to him. He shall be to us as a son, a brother,
and a father.<a id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">537</a> Let him fear nothing: he shall live
with us. Yes, in our own palace. All whom he will
meet there are friends of Jesus Christ. Our physician,
Master Henry, a truly christian man; the son of the
late Count Francis; the lord of Ch&acirc;teau-Rouge, and
his children, and many others, will rejoice at his
arrival. We ourselves,’ they added, ‘will be there
to receive him. Only bid him make haste; let him
come before next Lent.’&mdash;‘I promise you he shall,’
replied Roussel. The two princes undertook to set
up a printing establishment in order that Farel might
by means of the press circulate evangelical truth, not
only in La Marche, but throughout the kingdom.
Roussel wrote immediately to his friend; Toussaint
added his entreaties to those of the chaplain. ‘Never
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">500</span>
has any news caused me more joy,’ he said; ‘hasten
thither as fast as you can.’<a id="FNanchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">538</a></p>

<p>The young princes of La Marche were not the only
nobles of the court whom the Duchess of Alen&ccedil;on’s
influence attracted into the paths of the Gospel. Margaret
was not one of ‘those who cry aloud,’ says
a christian of her time, ‘but of those whose every
word is accompanied with teaching and imbued with
gentleness.’ Her eye was always on the watch to
discover souls whom she could attract to her Master.
Lords, ladies, and damsels of distinction, men of letters,
of the robe, of the sword, and even of the Church,
heard, either from her lips, or from those of Roussel
or of some other of her friends, the Word of life.
The nobility entertained a secret but very old dislike
to the priests, who had so often infringed their privileges;
and they would have liked nothing better
than to be emancipated from their yoke. Margaret
feared that the young nobles would be only half converted&mdash;that
there would be no renewal of the heart
and life in them; and the history of the wars of religion
shows but too plainly how well her fears were
founded. Knowing how difficult it is ‘to tread the path
to heaven,’ she insisted on the necessity of a real and
moral christianity, and said to the gay youths attracted
by the charms of her person and the splendour
of her rank:</p>

</div></div>

<p>Would Margaret succeed? A queen with all the
splendours of her station is not a good reformer; the
work needs poor and humble men. There is always
danger when princes turn missionaries; some of the
persons around them easily become hypocrites. Margaret
attracted men to the Gospel; but the greater
part of those who were called by her did not go far;
their christianity remained superficial. There were,
indeed, many enlightened understandings in the upper
ranks of French society, but there were few consciences
smitten by the Word of God. Many&mdash;and this is a
common error in every age&mdash;could see nothing but
intellectual truths in the doctrine of Jesus Christ:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">502</span>
a fatal error that may decompose the religious life of
a Church and destroy the national life of a people.
No tendency is more opposed to evangelical protestantism,
which depends not upon the intellectual, but
upon the moral faculty. When Luther experienced
those terrible struggles in the convent at Erfurth, it
was because his troubled conscience sought for peace;
and we may say of the Reformation, that it always began
with the awakening of the conscience. Conscience
is the palladium of protestantism, far more than the
statue of Pallas was the pledge of the preservation of
Troy. If the nobility compromised the Reformation
in France, it was because their consciences had not
been powerfully awakened.</p>

<p>Farel would have been the man fitted for this work.
He was one of those whose simple, serious, earnest
tones carry away the masses. His voice of thunder
made his hearers tremble. The strength of his convictions
created faith in their souls, the fervour of his
prayers raised them to heaven. When they listened to
him, ‘they felt,’ as Calvin says, ‘not merely a few
light pricks and stings, but were wounded and pierced
to the heart; and hypocrisy was dragged from those
wonderful and <i>more than tortuous</i> hiding-places which
lie deep in the heart of man.’ He pulled down and
built up with equal energy. Even his life&mdash;an apostle-ship
full of self-sacrifice, danger, and triumph&mdash;was as
effectual as his sermons. He was not only a minister
of the Word; he was a bishop also. He was able to
discern the young men fitted to wield the weapons of
the Gospel, and to direct them in the great war of the
age. Farel never attacked a place, however difficult
of access, which he did not take. Such was the man
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_503">503</span>
then called into France, and who seemed destined to
be its reformer. The letters of Roussel and Toussaint
inviting Farel were conveyed to Strasburg, and arrived
there in the month of December 1526.</p>

<p>Farel, who had remained alone in that city after
the departure of his friends, kept, as we have already
mentioned, his eyes turned towards France. He
waited and waited still, hesitating to go to Switzerland,
whither he was invited; but those gates of
France, from which he could not turn away his eyes,
still remained closed. He reflected; he asked himself
what place God had reserved for him. His piercing
glance would have desired to penetrate the future....
Should he not return into Dauphiny? At Gap and
Manosque he had relatives favourable to the Gospel:
his brother Walter, clerk of the episcopal court; his
brother Jean-Jacques, who expounded the Bible with
as much boldness as himself; Antoine Aloat, the notary,
who had married one of his nieces; his brother-in-law,
the noble Honorat Riquetti, ‘one of the ancestors
of Mirabeau,’ as the record-keeper of the Hautes
Alpes informs us.<a id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">540</a> There are certainly few names
we might be more surprised at seeing brought together
than those of Farel and Mirabeau; and yet
between these two Frenchmen there are at least two
points of contact: the power of their eloquence, and
the boldness of their reforms.</p>

<p>Farel did not return to Gap; had he done so, we
may suppose how he would have been received, from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_504">504</span>
the reception given to him some years later the particulars
of which an arch&aelig;ologist has discovered in the
‘Annals of the Capuchins’ of Gap. Farel, already an
old man, wishing to preach the Gospel in his native
country before God summoned him from the world,
went and took up his quarters in a corn-mill at the
gates of his native town, where he ‘dogmatised’ the
peasants from a French Bible, which he explained
‘in his fashion’&mdash;to use the words of the Roman-catholic
author. Erelong he began to preach in the
very heart of the town, in a chapel dedicated to St.
Colomba. The magistrate forbade his speaking, and
the parliament of Grenoble desired ‘to have him
burnt,’ say the Capuchins. Farel replied by a formal
refusal of obedience; upon which the vice-bailiff,
Benedict Olier, a zealous catholic, escorted by several
sergeants and police officers, proceeded to the chapel
where Farel was preaching. The door was shut;
they knocked, but nobody answered; they broke in,
and found a considerable throng; no one turned his
head, all were listening greedily to the reformer’s
words. The officers of justice went straight to the
pulpit; Farel was seized, and with ‘the crime’ (the
Bible) in his hand, according to the forcible expression
of the Capuchins, was led through the crowd and
shut up in prison. But the followers of the new
doctrine were already to be found in every class&mdash;in
the workman’s garret, in the tradesman’s shop, in the
fortified mansion of the noble, and sometimes even in
the bishop’s palace. During the night the reformers,
either by force or stratagem, took the brave old man
out of prison, carried him to the ramparts, and let him
down into the fields in a basket. ‘Accomplices’ were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_505">505</span>
waiting for him, and the preacher escaped along with
them.<a id="FNanchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">541</a> Now let us return to the year 1526.</p>

<p>Berthold Haller, the reformer of Berne, invited
Farel to Switzerland. The Bernese possessed certain
districts in Roman Switzerland where a missionary
speaking the French language was necessary. The
invitations of the pious Haller were repeated. If
France is shut, Switzerland is opening; Farel can
hesitate no longer; God removes him from one of
these countries and calls him to the other; he will
obey.</p>

<p>Farel, sadly grieved at the thought that his native
country rejected him, modestly departed from Strasburg,
on foot, one day in the month of December 1526;
and, journeying up the Rhine, directed his steps towards
those Alpine districts of which he became one of
the greatest reformers.<a id="FNanchor_542" href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">542</a> He was on the road when the
messenger of Toussaint and Roussel arrived at Strasburg....
It was too late. His friends, knowing that
he was going to Berne, sent the letters after him, and
it was at Aigle, where Farel had set up as a schoolmaster,
that he received the invitation of the lords of
La Marche. What shall he do? He might return.
Shall he put aside the call of God and of the lords of
Berne to follow that which the princes have sent him?
There was a fierce struggle in his soul. Was not
France his birthplace? It was; but ... it is too late!
God has spoken, he said to himself; and though invited
by princes, Farel remained at the humble desk in
his little school in the small town of Aigle, situated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_506">506</span>
between the majestic Dent du Midi and the rugged
glaciers of the Diablerets. Thus the reformer whom
many christians thought of for France was lost to
her.</p>

<p>France was not, however, without resources; she
still possessed Berquin, whom some called her <i>Luther</i>;
but while the exiles and the prisoners had heard the
hour of their deliverance strike, Berquin, though
treated with more consideration, was still deprived of
his liberty. Margaret was unwearied in her petitions
to the king. She even attempted to soften Montmorency;
but the Romish theologians made every
attempt to counteract her influence. Friends and
enemies were equally of opinion that if Berquin were
free, he would deal many a hard blow at the hierarchy.
At length, after an eight months’ struggle, Margaret
triumphed; Berquin left his prison in November
1526, just at the time when Farel was leaving
France.</p>

<p>The Duchess of Alen&ccedil;on’s gratitude immediately
burst forth. Calling Montmorency by a tenderer name
than usual, she said: ‘I thank you, my son, for the
pleasure you have done me in the cause of poor Berquin.
You may say that you have taken me from
prison, for I value it as a favour done to myself.’<a id="FNanchor_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">543</a> ...
‘My lord,’ she wrote to the king, ‘my desire to
obey your commands was already very great, but you
have doubled it by the charity you have been pleased
to show towards poor Berquin. He for whom he
suffered will take pleasure in the mercy you have
shown his servant and yours for your honour; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_507">507</span>
the confusion of those who have forgotten God
will not be less than the perpetual glory which God
will give you.’<a id="FNanchor_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">544</a></p>

<p>As soon as Berquin was free he began to meditate
on his great work, which was to destroy the power of
error. His liberation was not in his eyes a simple
deliverance from prison&mdash;it was a call. He cared little
(as Erasmus entreated him) to indulge in sweet repose
on the banks of the Somme; his earnest desire
was to fight. He held that the life of a christian
man should be a continual warfare. No truce with
Satan! Now, to him, Satan was the Sorbonne, and he
had no more doubts about the victory than if the war
were ended already. Berquin was universally known,
loved, and respected. To Farel’s decision and zeal
he added a knowledge of the world, which was then
most necessary. Margaret clung to him at least as
much as to Roussel. It was generally thought among
christians that God had brought him forth from prison
in order to set him at the head of the Reform in
France: Berquin himself thought so. The friends of
the Reformation rejoiced, and an important circumstance
increased their hopes.</p>

<p>Another joy was in store for Margaret. Francis
perceived at last that Henry VIII. preferred Anne
Boleyn to his illustrious sister, whose maid of honour
she had formerly been. From that hour he no longer
opposed the wishes of the King of Navarre, and in
November consented to his union with Madame of
Alen&ccedil;on.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_508">508</span></p>

<p>On the 24th of January, 1527, a brilliant throng
filled the chapel of the palace of St. Germain, where
the marriage of the king’s sister was to be solemnised,
and every mouth extolled the genius, grace, and virtues
of the princess. Margaret of France and Henry
d’Albret were united, and for a week there were magnificent
tournaments. Francis made very fine promises
to the married pair. ‘Make your mind easy,’
he said to Henry; ‘I will summon the emperor to
restore your kingdom of Navarre, and if he refuses, I
will give you an army to recover it.’<a id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">545</a> But not long
after, this prince, when drawing up a diplomatic paper
by which he bound Charles V. to restore his two sons,
then hostages at Madrid, inserted this clause: ‘<i>Item</i>,
the said king promises not to assist or favour the
King of Navarre in recovering his kingdom, although
he has married his beloved and only sister.’<a id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">546</a></p>

<p>At that time Margaret was thinking of other things
than earthly kingdoms. At this solemn moment
she turned her eyes towards eternity, and poured out
her heart on the bosom of a friend. ‘A thousand
chances may separate us from this world,’ she said to
Madame de la Rochefoucauld. ‘Whether we be near
or far, in peace or in war, on horseback or in our bed
... God takes and leaves whom he pleases.’<a id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">547</a> The
queen soon found that her lot was not all sunshine,
and that Henry d’Albret’s humour was not always
the same. Her husband’s weakness urged her to seek
more earnestly ‘the heavenly lover,’ as she said to
Madame de la Rochefoucauld; and the splendid wedding,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_509">509</span>
which was long talked of, made her desire the
better marriage. It was then she wrote:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Would that the day were come, O Lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So much desired by me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When by the cords of heavenly love<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I shall be drawn to thee!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">United in eternal life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The husband thou, and I the wife.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That wedding-day, O Lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My heart so longs to see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That neither wealth, nor fame, nor rank<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Can pleasure give to me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To me the world no more<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Can yield delight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unless thou, Lord, be with me there ...<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lo! all is dark as night.<a id="FNanchor_548" href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">548</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Prayer did not constitute the sole happiness of the
new queen: activity, charity, an eagerness to help
others, did not bring her less pleasure. By her marriage
she acquired more liberty to protect the Reform.
‘All eyes are fixed on you,’ Capito wrote to her.<a id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">549</a>
She thought that Roussel her confessor, and Michael
of Aranda her bishop, were about to advance notably
the kingdom of God, and rejoiced at seeing these
men of learning and morality pronounce daily more
strongly in favour of the truth.<a id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">550</a></p>

<p>The world was at one of the great turning-points
of its history; and the friends of letters and of the
Gospel said to themselves that France, which had
always been in the van of society during the middle
ages, would not now fall to the rear. Pure faith, they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_510">510</span>
thought, would penetrate every class, would renew
the fountains of moral life, and teach the people at
once obedience and liberty. Placed between the
middle and the modern age, Francis I. would make
the new times replace the old in everything. All, in
fact, was changing. Gothic architecture gave way to
the creations of the Renaissance; the study of the
classic authors took the place of the scholasticism of the
universities; and in the halls of the palace, mingled
with nobles and priests, was seen a crowd of new
persons&mdash;philologers, arch&aelig;ologists, poets, painters,
and doctors of the Roman law. When the light was
thus making its way everywhere, would the Church
alone remain closed against it? The Renaissance
had opened the gates to a new era; and the Reformation
would give the new generation the strength
necessary to enter them.</p>

<p>But where was the man who could give to the
world, and especially wherever the French language
was spoken, that strong and salutary impulse? It
was not Lef&egrave;vre, Roussel, Farel, or Berquin.... Who
was it then?</p>

<p>It is time that we should learn to know him.

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> tendencies of an epoch are generally personified
in some man whom it produces, but who soon
overrules these tendencies and leads them to the goal
which they could not otherwise have reached. To
the category of these eminent personages, of these
great men, at once the children and the masters of
their age, the reformers have belonged. But whilst
the heroes of the world make the forces of their epoch
the pedestal of their own greatness, the men of God
think only how they may be made to subserve the
greatness of their Master. The Reformation existed
in France, but the reformer was still unknown. Farel
would have been a powerful evangelist; but his country
had rejected him, and, being besides a man of battle,
he was neither the doctor nor the guide which the
work of the sixteenth century required. A greater
than Farel was about to appear, and we shall proceed
to watch his first steps in the path along which he
was afterwards to be the guide of many nations.</p>

<p>In the classes of the college of La Marche in Paris
there were, in the year 1526, a professor of about fifty,
and a scholar of seventeen: they were often seen together.
The scholar, instead of playing with his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_512">512</span>
class-fellows, attached himself to his master during the
hours of recreation, and listened eagerly to his conversation.
They were united as a distinguished
teacher and a pupil destined to become a great man
sometimes are. Their names were Mathurin Cordier
and John Calvin.<a id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">551</a> Mathurin was one of those men
of ancient mould, who always prefer the public good
to their own interests and glory; and accordingly,
neglecting the brilliant career which lay before him,
he devoted his whole life to the education of children.
Prior to Calvin’s arrival at Paris, he had the head
class in the college and taught it with credit; but he
was not satisfied; he would often pause in the middle
of his lessons, finding that his pupils possessed a mere
superficial knowledge of what they should have known
thoroughly. Teaching, instead of yielding him the
pleasure for which he thirsted, caused him only sorrow
and disgust. ‘Alas!’ he said, ‘the other masters
teach the children from ambition and vain-glory, and
that is why they are not well grounded in their
studies.’ He complained to the director of the college.
‘The scholars who join the first class,’ he said, ‘bring
up nothing solid: they are puffed out only to make a
show, so that I have to begin teaching them all over
again.’<a id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">552</a> Cordier therefore desired to resign the first
class and descend to the fourth, in order to lay the
foundations well.</p>

<p>He had just taken this humble department upon
himself, when one day, in the year 1523, he saw a
boy entering his school, thin, pale, diffident but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_513">513</span>
serious, and with a look of great intelligence. This
was John Calvin, then only fourteen years old. At
first he was shy and timid in the presence of the
learned professor; but the latter discovering in him a
scholar of a new kind, immediately became attached
to him, and took delight in developing his young and
comprehensive intellect. Gradually the apprehensions
of the Noyon boy were dissipated, and during the whole
time he spent at college he enjoyed the instructions
of the master, ‘as a singular blessing from God.’
Accordingly, when both of them, in after years, had
been driven from France, and had taken up their
abode among the mountains of Switzerland, Calvin,
then one of the great doctors of Europe, loved to
turn back with humility to these days of his boyhood,
and publicly displaying his gratitude, he said to
Cordier: ‘O Master Mathurin, O man gifted with
learning and great fear of God! when my father sent
me to Paris, while still a child, and possessing only a
few rudiments of the Latin language, it was God’s will
that I should have you for my teacher, in order that
I might be directed in the true path and right mode
of learning; and having first commenced the course
of study under your guidance, I advanced so far
that I can now in some degree profit the Church of
God.’<a id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">553</a></p>

<p>At the time of Calvin’s admission to college, both
master and pupil, equally strangers to evangelical
doctrine, devoutly followed the exercises of the
Romish worship. Doubtless Cordier was not satisfied
with teaching his favourite pupil Latin and Greek;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_514">514</span>
he initiated him also in that more general culture
which characterised the Renaissance; he imparted to
him a certain knowledge of antiquity and of ancient
civilisation, and inspired him early with the ardour
which animated the classical school; but when Calvin
says he was directed by Cordier ‘in the true path,’
he means the path of science, and not that of the
Gospel.</p>

<p>Some time after the scholar’s arrival, the director of
the college, perceiving him to be more advanced than
his class-mates, determined to remove him to a higher
form. When Calvin heard of this, he could not repress
his sorrow, and gave way to one of those fits of
anger and ill-humour of which he never entirely cured
himself. Never did promotion cause such grief to a
scholar. ‘Dear Master Mathurin,’ he said, ‘this man,
so thoughtless and void of judgment, who arranges
my studies at his will, or rather according to his silly
fancy, will not permit me to enjoy your instructions
any longer; he is putting me too soon into a higher
class.... What a misfortune!’<a id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">554</a></p>

<p>It was only a question of removing him, however,
from one class to another, and not, as some have supposed,
to another college. Calvin, while pursuing
higher studies, still remained under the same roof as
Cordier. He ran to him in the intervals of his lessons;
he hung upon his lips, and during the whole time of
his stay at La Marche, he continued to profit by
Cordier’s exquisite taste, pure latinity, vast erudition,
and admirable gifts in forming youth.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_515">515</span></p>

<p>Yet the moment came when it was necessary to
part. John Calvin had told his professor that he was
intended for a priest, according to the arrangement of
his father, who hoped that, thanks to the protection
of his powerful friends, his son would attain to high
dignity in the Church. The scholar must therefore
enter one of the colleges appointed for the training of
learned priests. There were two of these in Paris:
the Sorbonne and the Montaigu,<a id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">555</a> and the last was
chosen. One day, therefore, in 1526, the moment
arrived when the young man had to take leave of the
excellent Cordier. He was greatly distressed: he
would be separated from him, not only during the hours
of study, but for long days together. All through
life his affectionate nature clung to those who showed
sympathy to him. He left his master with a heart
overflowing with gratitude. ‘The instruction and
the training that you gave me,’ he said in after years,
‘have served me so well, that I declare with truth,
that I owe to you all the advancement which has
followed. I wish to render testimony of this to those
who come after us, in order that if they derive any
profit from my writings, they may know that it proceeds
in part from you.’<a id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">556</a> God has often great masters
in reserve for great men. Cordier, the teacher, subsequently
became the disciple of his scholar, and in his
turn thanked him, but it was for a divine teaching of
inestimable value.</p>

<p>When Calvin entered Montaigu College he was
distressed, for he could not hope to find there the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_516">516</span>
master he had lost; yet he was eager and happy
at having a wider field of studies opening before
him.</p>

<p>One of the first professors he noticed was a Spaniard,<a id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">557</a>
who, under a cold exterior, hid a loving heart,
and whose grave and silent air concealed deep affections.
Calvin felt attracted towards him. The fame
of the young scholar had preceded him at Montaigu;
and accordingly the doctor from the Iberian peninsula
fixed on him an attentive eye. Slow, calm, and
deliberate, as Spaniards generally are, he carefully
studied young Calvin, had several intimate conversations
with him, and soon passed from the greatest
coldness to the liveliest affection. ‘What a wonderful
genius!’ he exclaimed.<a id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">558</a></p>

<p>The professor had brought from Spain the fervent
catholicism, the minute observances, the blind zeal
that characterise his nation.</p>

<p>The scholar of Noyon could not, therefore, receive
from him any evangelical knowledge; on the contrary,
the Spaniard, delighted at seeing his pupil ‘obstinately
given to the superstitions of popery,’<a id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">559</a> hoped that
the young man would be a shining light in the
Church.</p>

<p>Calvin, full of admiration for the poets, orators, and
philosophers of antiquity, studied them eagerly and
enriched his mind with their treasures; in his writings
we often meet with quotations from Seneca, Virgil, and
Cicero. He soon left all his comrades far behind.
The professor, who looked on him with surprise, promoted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_517">517</span>
him to the class of philosophy, although he had
not attained the required age.<a id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">560</a> Then a new world,
the world of thought, opened before his fine understanding;
he traversed it with indefatigable ardour.
Logic, dialectics, and philosophy possessed for him
an indescribable charm.<a id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">561</a></p>

<p>Calvin made many friends among his fellow-collegians;
yet he soared high above them all by the
morality of his character. There was no pedantry, no
affectation about him; but when he was walking in
the courts of the college, or in the halls where the
pupils assembled, he could not witness their quarrels,
their follies, their levity of manner, and not reprove
them faithfully. ‘He finds fault with everything,’
complained a scholar of equivocal conduct. ‘Profit
rather by the advice of so young and conscientious a
censor,’ answered the wiser ones.<a id="FNanchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">562</a> ‘Roman catholics
whose testimony was beyond reproach,’ says Theodore
Beza, ‘told me of this many years after, when his
name had become famous.’<a id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">563</a> ‘It is not the act alone,’
said Calvin subsequently, ‘but the look, and even the
secret longing, which make men guilty.’&mdash;‘No man,’
says one of his adversaries, ‘ever felt so great a hatred
of adultery.’<a id="FNanchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">564</a> In his opinion, chastity was the crown
of youth, and the centre of every virtue.</p>

<p>The heads of Montaigu College were enthusiastic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_518">518</span>
supporters of popery. Beda, so notorious for his
violent declamations against the Reformation, for his
factious intrigues, and for his tyrannical authority,
was principal.<a id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">565</a> He watched with satisfaction young
Calvin, who, a strict observer of the practices of the
Church, never missed a fast, a retreat, a mass, or a procession.
‘It is a long time,’ it was said, ‘since Sorbonne
or Montaigu had so pious a seminarist.’ As
long as Luther, Calvin, and Farel were in the Papal
Church, they belonged to its strictest sect. The austere
exercises of a devotee’s life were the schoolmaster that
brought them to Christ. ‘I was at that time so obstinately
given to the superstitions of popery,’ said
Calvin, ‘that it seemed impossible that I should ever
be pulled out of the deep mire.’</p>

<p>He surprised his tutors no less by his application to
study. Absorbed in his books, he often forgot the
hours for his meals and even for sleep. The people
who lived in the neighbourhood used to show each
other, as they returned home in the evening, a tiny
and solitary gleam, a window lit up nearly all the night
through: they long talked of it in that quarter.
John Calvin outstripped his companions in philosophy,
as he had done in grammar. He then applied to the
study of theology, and, strange to say, was enraptured
with Scotus, Bonaventure, and Thomas Aquinas. The
last-mentioned writer had especial charms for him.
If Calvin had not been a reformer, he would have become
a Thomist. Scholastics appeared to him the
queen of sciences; but he was the impassioned lover
at first, only that he might be afterwards its terrible
adversary.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_519">519</span></p>

<p>His father, secretary to the diocese of Noyon, always
entertained the hope of making his son a dignitary of
the Church. With this object he cultivated the favour
of the bishop, and spoke humbly to the canons. John
had been for some years chaplain of La Gesine, but
this did not satisfy the father; and, accordingly, when
the living of St. Martin of Marteville became vacant,
Gerard Cauvin solicited and, to his great delight, obtained
that church for the student of Montaigu, who,
as yet, had only received the tonsure. This was in
the year 1527. Calvin, taking advantage probably of
vacation time, went to see his family and his new
parish. It has been supposed that he preached there.
‘Although he had not yet taken orders,’ says Beda,
‘he delivered several sermons before the people.’ Did
he really go into the pulpits of his native country at
the time when his inward struggles were beginning?
To have heard him would have been a great satisfaction
to his father, and his age was no obstacle to his
preaching; some great preachers have begun still
earlier. But it seems to us, after examining the passage,
that he did not speak in his own church until
later, when the Gospel had completely triumphed in
his heart. But, however that may be, Calvin had a
parish at eighteen: he was not, however, in holy
orders.</p>

<p>A new light, which had but little resemblance to
the false radiance of scholasticism, began to shine
around him. At that time there was a breath of the
Gospel in the air, and that reviving breeze reached
the scholar within the walls of his college, and the
monk in the recesses of his convent; no one was
protected against its influence. Calvin heard people
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_520">520</span>
talking of the Holy Scriptures, of Lef&egrave;vre, of Luther,
of Melanchthon, and of what was passing in Germany.
When the rays of the sun rise in the Alps, it is
the highest peaks that catch them first; in like manner,
the most eminent minds were enlightened first.
But what some accepted, others rejected. In the colleges
there were sharp and frequent altercations, and
Calvin was at first in the number of the most inflexible
adversaries of the Reformation.</p>

<p>A young man of Noyon, his cousin, and a little older
than him, often went to see him at college. Pierre
Robert Oliv&eacute;tan, without possessing the transcendant
genius of his young relation, was gifted with a solid
mind, great perseverance in the discharge of his duties,
unshaken fidelity to his convictions, and a holy boldness
when it became necessary to combat error. This
he showed at Geneva, where his was one of the first
voices raised in favour of the Gospel. When Calvin
discovered that the friend of his childhood was tainted
with heresy, he felt the keenest sorrow. What a pity!
he thought; for Oliv&eacute;tan was acquainted not only with
Latin, but with Greek and even Hebrew. He read
the Old and New Testaments in their original languages,
and was familiar with the Septuagint. The
study of the Holy Scriptures, of which Picardy seems
to have been the birthplace in France (Lef&egrave;vre, Oliv&eacute;tan,
and Calvin were all three Picardins), had increased
considerably since Lef&egrave;vre’s translation was
published. It is true that most of those who engaged
in it ‘looked at the Scriptures in a cursory manner,’
says Calvin; ‘but others dug deep for the treasure
that lay hidden there.’ Of this number was Oliv&eacute;tan,
and he it was who one day gave to the people speaking
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_521">521</span>
the French tongue a translation of the Scriptures that
became famous in the history of the Bible.</p>

<p>The chronology of Calvin’s life during the period
of his studies is less easily settled than that of Luther.
We have been able to point out almost the very days
when the most striking transformations of his faith
were completed in the reformer of Germany. It is
not so with the reformer of Geneva. The exact moment
when this struggle, this defeat, or that victory
took place in Calvin’s soul, cannot be determined.
Must we therefore suppress the history of his spiritual
combats? To pass them over in silence would be to
fail in the first duty of an historian.<a id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">566</a></p>

<p>Oliv&eacute;tan, who was then in all the fervour of proselytism,
felt great interest in his catholic cousin,
while the latter would have wished at any cost to
bring back his friend into the bosom of the Church.
The two youthful Picardins had many long and animated
conversations together, in which each strove to
convert the other.<a id="FNanchor_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">567</a> ‘There are many false religions,’
said Oliv&eacute;tan, ‘and only one true.’ Calvin assented.
‘The false are those which men have invented, according
to which we are saved by our own works; the true
is that which comes from God, according to which
salvation is given freely from on high.... Choose the
true.’<a id="FNanchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">568</a> Calvin made a sign of dissent. ‘True
religion,’ continued Oliv&eacute;tan, ‘is not that infinite mass
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_522">522</span>
of ceremonies and observances which the Church imposes
upon its followers, and which separate souls from
Christ. O my dear friend! leave off shouting out with
the papists: “The fathers! the doctors! the Church!”
and listen instead to the prophets and apostles. Study
the Scriptures.’<a id="FNanchor_569" href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">569</a> ‘I will have none of your doctrines,’
answered Calvin; ‘their novelty offends me. I cannot
listen to you. Do you imagine that I have been trained
all my life in error?... No! I will strenuously resist
your attacks.’<a id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">570</a> In after years Calvin said: ‘My heart,
hardened by superstition, remained insensible to all
these appeals.’ The two cousins parted, little satisfied
with each other. Calvin, terrified at his friend’s innovations,
fell on his knees in the chapels, and prayed the
saints to intercede for this misguided soul.<a id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">571</a> Oliv&eacute;tan
shut himself up in his chamber and prayed to Christ.</p>

<p>Yet Calvin, whose mind was essentially one of observation,
could not be present in the midst of the
great movement going on in the world without reflecting
on truth, on error, and on himself. Oftentimes
when alone, and when the voices of men had ceased to
be heard, a more powerful voice spoke to his soul,
and his chamber became the theatre of struggles as
fierce as those in the cell at Erfurth. Through the
same tempests both these great reformers reached the
same haven. Calvin arrived at faith by the same
practical way which had led Farel and Augustine,
Luther and St. Paul.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_523">523</span></p>

<p>The student of Montaigu, uneasy and troubled after
his controversies with his young relative, shut himself
up in his little room and examined himself; he asked
himself what he was, and where he was going....
‘O Lord,’ he said, ‘thou knowest that I profess the
christian faith such as I learnt it in my youth.<a id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">572</a> ...
And yet there is something wanting.... I have been
taught to worship thee as my only God; but I am
ignorant of the true worship I ought to give.<a id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">573</a> ...
I have been taught that thy Son has ransomed me by
his death; ... but I have never felt in my heart the
virtue of this redemption.<a id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">574</a> I have been taught that
some day there will be a resurrection; but I dread it,
as the most terrible of days.<a id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">575</a> ... Where shall I find
the light that I need?... Alas! thy Word, which
should enlighten thy people like a lamp, has been
taken from us.<a id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">576</a> ... Men talk in its place of a hidden
knowledge, and of a small number of initiates whose
oracles we must receive.... O God, illumine me with
thy light!’</p>

<p>The superiors of Montaigu College began to feel
some uneasiness about their student. The Spanish
professor, inclined, like his countrymen, to the spirit
of intolerance, saw with horror the young man, whose
devotion had charmed him at first, discontented with
the traditional religion, and ready perhaps to forsake
it. Could the best of their pupils fall into heresy?...
The tutors entered into conversation with Calvin,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_524">524</span>
and, as yet full of affection for the young man, sought
to strengthen him in the Roman faith. ‘The highest
wisdom of christians,’ they said, ‘is to submit blindly
to the Church,<a id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">577</a> and their highest dignity is the righteousness
of their works.’<a id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">578</a>&mdash;‘Alas!’ replied Calvin,
who was conscious of the guilt within him, ‘I am a
miserable sinner!’&mdash;‘That is true,’ answered the
professors, ‘but there is a means of obtaining mercy:
it is by satisfying the justice of God.<a id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">579</a> ... Confess
your sins to a priest, and ask humbly for absolution....
Blot out the memory of your offences by your
good works, and, if anything should still be wanting,
supply it by the addition of solemn sacrifices and
purifications.’</p>

<p>When he heard these words, Calvin reflected
that he who listens to a priest listens to Christ himself.
Being subdued, he went to church, entered the
confessional, fell on his knees, and confessed his sins
to God’s minister, asking for absolution and humbly
accepting every penance imposed upon him. And
immediately, with all the energy of his character, he
endeavoured to acquire the merits demanded by his
confessor. ‘O God!’ he said, ‘I desire by my good
works to blot out the remembrance of my trespasses.<a id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">580</a>
He performed the ‘satisfactions’ prescribed
by the priest; he even went beyond the task imposed
upon him, and hoped that after so much labour he
would be saved.... But, alas! his peace was not of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_525">525</span>
long duration. A few days, a few hours perhaps, had
not passed, when, having given way to a movement of
impatience or anger, his heart was again troubled: he
thought he saw God’s eye piercing to the depths of
his soul and discovering its impurities. ‘O God!’ he
exclaimed in alarm, ‘thy glance freezes me with
terror.’<a id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">581</a> ... He hurried again to the confessional.&mdash;‘God
is a strict judge,’ the priest told him, ‘who
severely punishes iniquity. Address your prayers to
the saints first.’<a id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">582</a> And Calvin, who, in after years,
branded as blasphemers those who invented ‘false
intercessors,’ invoked the saints and prayed them by
their intercession to appease a God who appeared to
him so inexorable.</p>

<p>Having thus found a few moments of relief, he
applied again to his studies; he was absorbed in his
books; he grew pale over Scotus and Thomas Aquinas;
but in the midst of his labours a sudden trouble took
possession of his mind, and pushing away from him
the volumes that lay before him, he exclaimed: ‘Alas!
my conscience is still very far from true tranquillity.’<a id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">583</a>
His heart was troubled, his imagination excited, he
saw nothing but abysses on every side, and with a
cry of alarm he said: ‘Every time that I descend
into the depths of my heart; every time, O God, that
I lift up my soul to thy throne, extreme terror comes
over me.<a id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">584</a> ... I see that no purification, no satisfaction
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_526">526</span>
can heal my disease.<a id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">585</a> My conscience is pierced
with sharp stings.’<a id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">586</a></p>

<p>Thus step by step did Calvin descend to the lowest
depths of despair; and quite heartbroken, and
looking like one dead, he resolved to take no further
pains about his salvation. He lived more with his
fellow-pupils, he even shared in their amusements;
he visited his friends in the city, sought such conversation
as would divert his thoughts, and desired, with
the Athenians of old, either to tell or to hear some
new thing. Will the work of God, begun in his
heart, remain unperfected?</p>

<p>This year an event took place which could not fail
to stir the depths of Calvin’s soul.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_527">527</span></p>

<span class="small">CALVIN’S CONVERSION AND CHANGE OF CALLING.<br />

(1527.)</span></h2>


<p class="fleft">‘</p><p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> kingdom of Christ is strengthened and established
more by the blood of martyrs than by
force of arms,’ said the doctor of Noyon one day.<a id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">587</a>
At this period he had occasion to experience the truth
of the statement.</p>

<p>One day in the year 1527, a man thirty-six years old,
of good family&mdash;he was related to M. de Lude&mdash;of
ecclesiastical rank, prothonotary, and holding several
benefices, Nicholas Doullon by name, having been
accused of heresy, stood in front of the cathedral
of Notre Dame, while an immense crowd of citizens,
priests, and common people were looking on. The
executioner had gone in the morning to the prison,
stripped the prothonotary of his official robes, and
having passed a rope round his neck and put a
taper in his hand, had conducted him in this guise to
the front of the church of the Virgin. The poor fellow
had seen better days: he had often gone to the
palaces of the Louvre, St. Germain, and Fontainebleau,
and mingled with the nobles, in the presence of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_528">528</span>
king, his mother, and his sister; he had also been one
of the officers of Clement VII. The good folks of
Paris, whom this execution had drawn together, said
to one another as they witnessed the sad spectacle:
‘He frequented the king’s court, and has lived at
Rome in the pope’s service.’<a id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">588</a></p>

<p>Doullon was accused of having uttered a great
blasphemy against the glorious mother of our Lord
and against our Lord himself: he had denied that the
host was very Christ. The clergy had taken advantage
of the king’s absence, and had used unprecedented
haste in the trial. ‘He was taken the Thursday before,’
and four days later was standing bareheaded
and barefooted, with the rope about his neck, in front
of the metropolitan church of Paris. Everybody was
listening to hear the apology he would make to the
Virgin; but they listened in vain: Doullon remained
firm in his faith to the last. Accordingly, the hangman
again laid hands on him, and the prothonotary,
guarded by the sergeants, and preceded and followed
by the crowd, was led to the Gr&egrave;ve, where he was
fastened to the stake and burnt alive.<a id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">589</a> The execution
of a priest of some dignity in the Church made
a sensation in Paris, especially in the schools and
among the disciples of the Reform. ‘Ah!’ said Calvin
subsequently, ‘the torments of the saints whom
the hand of the Lord makes invincible, should give us
boldness; for thus we have beforehand the pledge of
our victory in the persons of our brethren.’</p>

<p>While death was thinning the ranks of the evangelical
army, new soldiers were taking the place of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_529">529</span>
those who had disappeared. Calvin had been wandering
for some time in darkness, despairing of salvation
by the path of the pope, and not knowing that of Jesus
Christ. One day (we cannot say when) he saw light
breaking through the obscurity, and a consoling
thought suddenly entered his heart. ‘A new form
of doctrine has risen up,’ he said.<a id="FNanchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">590</a> ‘If I have been
mistaken ... if Oliv&eacute;tan, if my other friends, if those
who give their lives to preserve their faith are right
... if they have found in that path the peace which
the doctrines of the priests refuse me?’ ... He began
to pay attention to the things that were told him; he
began to examine into the state of his soul. A ray of
light shone into it and exposed his sin. His heart
was troubled: it seemed to him that every word of
God he found in Scripture tore off the veil and reproached
him with his trespasses. He shed floods of
tears. ‘Of a surety,’ he said, ‘these new preachers
know how to prick the conscience.<a id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">591</a> Now that I am
prepared to be really attentive, I begin to see, thanks
to the light that has been brought me, in what a
slough of error I have hitherto been wallowing;<a id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">592</a> with
how many stains I am disfigured ... and above all,
what is the eternal death that threatens me.’<a id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">593</a> A
great trembling came over him; he paced his room
as Luther had once paced his cell at Erfurth. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_530">530</span>
uttered (he tells us) deep groans and shed floods of
tears.<a id="FNanchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">594</a> He was crushed beneath the weight of his
sin. Terrified at the divine holiness, like a leaf
tossed by the wind, like a man frightened by a
violent thunderstorm, he exclaimed: ‘O God! thou
keepest me bowed down, as if thy bolts were falling
on my head.’<a id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">595</a> ... Then he fell at the feet of the
Almighty, exclaiming: ‘I condemn with tears my
past manner of life, and transfer myself to thine.
Poor and wretched, I throw myself on the mercy
which thou hast shown us in Jesus Christ: I enter
that only harbour of salvation.<a id="FNanchor_596" href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">596</a> ... O God, reckon
not up against me that terrible desertion and disgust
of thy Word, from which thy marvellous bounty has
rescued me.’<a id="FNanchor_597" href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">597</a></p>

<p>Following Oliv&eacute;tan’s advice, Calvin applied to the
study of Scripture, and everywhere he found Christ.
‘O Father!’ he said, ‘his sacrifice has appeased thy
wrath; his blood has washed away my impurities;
his cross has borne my curse; his death has atoned
for me<a id="FNanchor_598" href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">598</a> .... We had devised for ourselves many useless
follies<a id="FNanchor_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">599</a> ... but thou hast placed thy Word before
me like a torch, and thou hast touched my heart,
in order that I should hold in abomination all other
merits save that of Jesus.’<a id="FNanchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">600</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_531">531</span></p>

<p>Calvin had, however, the final struggle to go through.
To him, as to Luther, the great objection was the
question of the Church. He had always respected
the authority of a Church which he believed to have
been founded by the apostles and commissioned to
gather mankind round Jesus Christ; and these
thoughts often disturbed him. ‘There is one thing,’
he told the evangelicals, ‘which prevents my believing
you: that is, the respect due to the Church.<a id="FNanchor_601" href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">601</a>
The majesty of the Church must not be diminished.<a id="FNanchor_602" href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">602</a> ...
I cannot separate from it.’</p>

<p>Calvin’s friends at Paris, and afterwards perhaps
Wolmar and others at Orleans and Bourges, did not
hesitate to reply to him.<a id="FNanchor_603" href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">603</a> ‘There is a great difference
between separating from the Church and trying
to correct the vices with which it is stained.<a id="FNanchor_604" href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">604</a> ... How
many antichrists have held the place in its bosom
which belongs to the pastors only!’</p>

<p>Calvin understood at last that the unity of the
Church cannot and ought not to exist except in the
truth. His friends, perceiving this, spoke openly to
him against the Pope of Rome.&mdash;‘Men take him for
Christ’s vicar, Peter’s successor, and the head of the
Church.... But these titles are empty scarecrows.<a id="FNanchor_605" href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">605</a>
Far from permitting themselves to be dazzled by
these big words, the faithful ought to discriminate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_532">532</span>
the matter truly. If the pope has risen to such height
and magnificence, it is because the world was plunged
in ignorance and smitten with blindness.<a id="FNanchor_606" href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">606</a> Neither
by the voice of God, nor by a lawful call of the
Church, has the pope been constituted its prince
and head; it is by his own authority and by
his own will alone.... He elected himself.<a id="FNanchor_607" href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">607</a> In
order that the kingdom of Christ may stand, the
tyranny with which the pope oppresses the nations
must come to an end.’<a id="FNanchor_608" href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">608</a> Calvin’s friends, as he
tells us, ‘demolished by the Word of God the
princedom of the pope and his exceeding elevation.’<a id="FNanchor_609" href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">609</a></p>

<p>Calvin, not content with hearing the arguments of
his friends, ‘searched the Scriptures thoroughly,’ and
found numerous evidences corroborating the things
that had been told him. He was convinced. ‘I see
quite clearly,’ he said, ‘that the true order of the
Church has been lost;<a id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">610</a> that the keys which should
preserve discipline have been counterfeited;<a id="FNanchor_611" href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">611</a> that
christian liberty has been overthrown;<a id="FNanchor_612" href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">612</a> and that
when the princedom of the pope was set up, the kingdom
of Christ was thrown down.’<a id="FNanchor_613" href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">613</a> Thus fell the papacy
in the mind of the future reformer; and Christ
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_533">533</span>
became to him the only king and almighty head of
the Church.</p>

<p>What did Calvin then? The converted often believed
themselves called to remain in the Church that
they might labour at its purification; did he separate
himself from Rome? Theodore Beza, his most intimate
friend, says: ‘Calvin, having been taught the
true religion by one of his relations named Pierre
Robert Oliv&eacute;tan, and having carefully read the holy
books, began to hold the teaching of the Roman
Church in horror, and had the intention of renouncing
its communion.’<a id="FNanchor_614" href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">614</a> This testimony is positive; and
yet Beza only says in this extract that he ‘had the
intention.’ The separation was not yet decided and
absolute. Calvin felt the immense importance of
the step. However, he resolved to break with Catholicism,
if necessary, in order to possess the truth. ‘I
desire concord and unity, O Lord,’ he said; ‘but the
unity of the Church I long for is that which has its
beginning and its ending in thee.<a id="FNanchor_615" href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">615</a> If, to have peace
with those who boast of being the first in the Church,
I must purchase it by denying the truth ... then I
would rather submit to everything than condescend
to such an abominable compact!’ The reformer’s
character, his faith, his decision, his whole life are
found in these words. He will endeavour to remain
in the Church, but ... with the truth.</p>

<p>Calvin’s conversion had been long and slowly ripening;
and yet, in one sense, the change was instantaneous.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_534">534</span>
‘When I was the obstinate slave of the
superstitions of popery,’ he says, ‘and it seemed impossible
to drag me out of the deep mire, God by a
sudden conversion subdued me, and made my heart
obedient to his Word.’<a id="FNanchor_616" href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">616</a> When a city is taken, it is
in one day and by a single assault that the conqueror
enters and plants his flag upon the ramparts; and yet
for months, for years perhaps, he has been battering
at the walls.</p>

<p>Thus was this memorable conversion accomplished,
which by saving one soul became for the Church, and
we may even say for the human race, the principle of
a great transformation. Then, it was only a poor
student converted in a college; now, the light which
this scholar set on a candlestick has spread to the
ends of the world, and elect souls, scattered among
every nation, acknowledge in his conversion the origin
of their own.</p>

<p>It was in Paris, as we have seen, that Calvin received
a new birth; it cannot be placed later, as some
have wished to do, without contradicting the most
positive testimony. Calvin, according to Theodore
Beza, was instructed in the true religion by Oliv&eacute;tan,
<i>before</i> he went to Orleans;<a id="FNanchor_617" href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">617</a> we know, moreover, that
Calvin, either at Bourges or at Orleans, ‘wonderfully
advanced the kingdom of God.’<a id="FNanchor_618" href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">618</a> How could he have
done so if he had not known that kingdom? Calvin at
the age of nineteen, gifted with a deep and conscientious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_535">535</span>
soul, surrounded by relations and friends zealous for
the Gospel, living at Paris in the midst of a religious
movement of great power, was himself touched by the
Spirit of God. Most certainly everything was not
done then; some of the traits, which we have indicated
after the reformer himself, may, as we have
already remarked, belong to his residence at Orleans
or at Bourges; but the essential work was done in
1527. Such is the conclusion at which we have
arrived after careful study.</p>

<p>There are men in our days who look upon conversion
as an imaginary act, and say simply that a man
has changed his opinion. They freely grant that
God can create a moral being once, but do not concede
him the liberty of creating it a second time&mdash;of
transforming it. Conversion is always the work of
God. There are forces working in nature which
cause the earth to bring forth its fruit; and yet some
would maintain that God cannot work in the heart of
man to create a new fruit!... Human will is not
sufficient to explain the changes manifested in man;
there, if anywhere, is found something mysterious and
divine.</p>

<p>The young man did not immediately make his conversion
publicly known; it was only one or two of
his superiors that had any knowledge of his struggles,
and they endeavoured to hide them from the pupils.
They fancied it was a mere passing attack of that
<i>fever</i> under which so many people were suffering,
and believed that the son of the episcopal secretary
would once more obediently place himself under the
crook of the Church. The Spanish professor, who
came from a country where fiery passions break out
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_536">536</span>
under a burning sky, and where religious fanaticism
demands its victims, had doubtless waged an implacable
war against the student’s new convictions; but
information in this respect is wanting. Calvin carefully
hid his treasure; he stole away from his companions,
retired to some corner, and sought for communion
with God alone. ‘Being naturally rather
wild and shy,’ he tells us,<a id="FNanchor_619" href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">619</a> ‘I have always loved
peace and tranquillity; accordingly I began then to
seek for a hiding-place and the means of withdrawing
from notice into some out-of-the-way spot.’ This
reserve on Calvin’s part may have led to the belief
that his conversion did not take place until later.</p>

<p>The news of what was passing in Paris reached the
little town in Picardy where Calvin was born. It
would be invaluable to possess the letters which he
wrote to his father during this time of struggle, and
even those of Oliv&eacute;tan; but we have neither. John’s
relations with Oliv&eacute;tan were known at Noyon; there
was no longer any doubt about the heretical opinions
of the young cur&eacute; of St. Martin of Motteville....
What trouble for his family, and especially for the episcopal
notary! To renounce the hope of one day seeing
his son vicar-general, bishop, and perhaps cardinal,
was distressing to the ambitious father. Yet he
decided promptly, and as it was all-important for him
that Calvin should be something, he gave another
direction to his immoderate thirst for honours. He
said to himself that by making his son study the law,
he would perhaps be helping him to shake off these
new ideas; and that, in any case, the pursuit of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_537">537</span>
law was quite as sure a road, and even surer, to wealth
and high station.<a id="FNanchor_620" href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">620</a> Duprat, at first a plain lawyer,
and afterwards president of the parliament, is now
(he thought) high chancellor of France, and the first
personage in the realm after the king. Gerard, whose
mind was fertile in schemes of success for himself
and for others, continued to build his castles in the
air in honour of his son; only he changed his sphere,
and instead of placing them in the domain of the
Church, he erected them in the domain of the State.</p>

<p>Thus, while the son had a new faith and a new
life, the father had a new plan. Theodore Beza has
pointed out this coincidence. After speaking of
Calvin’s vocation to the ecclesiastical profession, he
adds that a double change, which took place at that
time in the minds of both father and son, led to the
setting aside of this resolution in favour of another.<a id="FNanchor_621" href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">621</a>
The coincidence struck Calvin himself, and it was he
no doubt who pointed it out to his friend at Geneva.
It was not therefore the resolution of Gerard Cauvin
that decided his son’s calling, as some have supposed.
At the first glance the two decisions seem independent
of each other; but it appears probable to me
that it was the change in the son which led to
that of the father, and not the change in the father
which led to that of the son. The young man submitted
with joy to the order he received. Gerard, by
taking his son from his theological studies, wished
to withdraw him from heresy; but he was mistaken.
Had not Luther first studied the law at Erfurth?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_538">538</span>
Did not Calvin by this same study prepare himself
better for the career of a reformer, than by the
priesthood?</p>

<p>Conversion is the fundamental act of the Gospel and
of the Reformation. From the transformation effected
in the individual the transformation of the world is
destined to result. This act, which in some is of very
short duration and leads readily to faith, is a long
operation in others; the power of sin is continually
renewed in them, neither the new man nor the old man
being able, for a time, to obtain a decisive victory.
We have here an image of christianity. It is a struggle
of the new man against the old man&mdash;a struggle
that has lasted more than eighteen hundred years.
The new man is continually gaining ground; the old
man grows weaker and retires; but the hour of
triumph has not yet come. Yet that hour is certain.
The Reformation of the sixteenth century, like the
Gospel of the first (to employ the words of Christ),
‘is like unto leaven, which a woman took and hid in
three measures of meal, <i>until the whole was leavened</i>.’<a id="FNanchor_622" href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">622</a>
The three great nations on earth have already
tasted of this heavenly leaven. It is fermenting, and
soon all the ‘lump’ will be leavened.

<span class="small">BERQUIN DECLARES WAR AGAINST POPERY.<br />

(1527.)</span></h2>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Will</span> the reformer whom God is now preparing
for France find in Francis I. the support which
Luther found in Frederick the Wise? Since his return
from captivity in Spain, the king, as we have seen,
appeared to yield to the influence of his sister and to
the movement of the age. Slightly touched by the
new breath, he sometimes listened to the sermons of
the evangelicals, and read fragments of the Holy Scriptures
with Margaret. One day, when the beauty of
the Gospel had spoken to his heart, he exclaimed:
‘It is infamous that the monks should dare to call
that <i>heresy</i> which is the very doctrine of God!’
But the Reformation could not please him; liberty,
which was one of its elements, clashed with the
despotism of the prince; and holiness, another principle,
condemned his irregularities.</p>

<p>Opposition to popery had, however, a certain charm
for Francis, whose supreme rule it was to lower
everything that encroached upon his greatness. He
well remembered that the popes had more than once
humbled the kings of France, and that Clement VII.
was habitually in the interest of the emperor. But
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_540">540</span>
political motives will never cause a real Reformation;
and hence there are few princes who have
contributed so much as Francis I. to propagate superstition
instead of truth, servility instead of liberty,
licentiousness instead of morality. If the Word of
God does not exercise its invisible power on the
nations, they are by that very defect deprived of the
conditions necessary to the maintenance of order and
liberty. They may shine forth with great brilliancy,
but they pass easily from disorder to tyranny. They
are like a stately ship, decorated with the most glorious
banners, and armed with the heaviest artillery; but as
it wants the necessary ballast, it drives between two
extreme dangers, now dashing against Scylla, and
now tossed upon Charybdis.</p>

<p>While Francis I. was trifling with the Reform,
other powers in France remained its irreconcilable
enemies. The members of the parliament, honourable
men for the most part, but lawyers still, unable to
recognise the truth (and few could in those days)
that spiritual matters were not within their jurisdiction,
did not confine themselves to judging temporal
offences, but made themselves the champions of the
law of the realm against the law of God. The doctors
of the Sorbonne, on their part, seeing that the twofold
authority of Holy Scripture and of conscience
would ruin theirs, opposed with all their strength the
substitution of the religious for the clerical element.
‘They inveighed against the reformers,’ says Roussel,
‘and endeavoured to stir up the whole world against
them.’<a id="FNanchor_623" href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">623</a> The more the king inclined to peace, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_541">541</span>
more the Sorbonne called for war, counting its battalions
and preparing for the fight. The general placed
at its head was, Erasmus tells us, ‘a many-headed
monster, breathing poison from every mouth.’<a id="FNanchor_624" href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">624</a> Beda&mdash;for
he was the monster&mdash;taking note of the age of
Lef&egrave;vre, the weakness of Roussel, the absence of Farel,
and not knowing Calvin’s power, said to himself that
Berquin would be the Luther of France, and against
him he directed all his attacks.</p>

<p>Louis de Berquin, who was liberated by the king,
in November 1526, from the prison into which the
Bedists had thrown him, had formed the daring plan
of rescuing France from the hands of the pope. He
was then thirty years of age, and possessed a charm
in his character, a purity in his life, which even his
enemies admired, unwearied application in study, indomitable
energy, obstinate zeal, and firm perseverance
for the accomplishment of his work. Yet there was
one fault in him. Calvin, like Luther, proceeded
by the positive method, putting the truth in front,
and in this way seeking to effect the conversion of
souls; but Berquin inclined too much at times to
the negative method. Yet he was full of love, and
having found in God a father, and in Jesus a saviour,
he never contended with theologians, except to impart
to souls that peace and joy which constituted his own
happiness.</p>

<p>Berquin did not move forward at hazard; he had
calculated everything. He had said to himself that
in a country like France the Reformation could not
be carried through against the king’s will; but he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_542">542</span>
thought that Francis would allow the work to be
done, if he did not do it himself. When he had been
thrust into prison in 1523, had not the king, then on
his way to Italy, sent the captain of the guards to
fetch him, in order to save his life?<a id="FNanchor_625" href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">625</a> When in 1526
he had been transferred as a heretic by the clerical
judges to lay judges, had not Francis once more set
him at liberty?<a id="FNanchor_626" href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">626</a></p>

<p>But Berquin’s noble soul did not suffer the triumph
of truth to depend upon the support of princes. A
new era was then beginning. God was reanimating
society which had lain torpid during the night of the
middle ages, and Berquin thought that God would
not be wanting to the work. It is a saying of Calvin’s
‘that the brightness of the divine power alone scatters
all silly enchantments and vain imaginations.’ Berquin
did not distinguish this truth so clearly, but he was
not ignorant of it. At the same time, knowing that
an army never gains a victory unless it is bought
with the deaths of many of its soldiers, he was ready
to lay down his life.</p>

<p>At the moment when he was advancing almost
alone to attack the colossus, he thought it his duty to
inform his friends: ‘Under the cloak of religion,’ he
wrote to Erasmus, ‘the priests hide the vilest passions,
the most corrupt manners, the most scandalous unbelief.
We must tear off the veil that conceals this
hideous mystery, and boldly brand the Sorbonne,
Rome, and all their hirelings, with impiety.’</p>

<p>At these words his friends were troubled and
alarmed; they endeavoured to check his impetuosity.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_543">543</span>
‘The greater the success you promise yourself,’ wrote
Erasmus, ‘the more afraid I am.... O my friend!
live in retirement; taste the sweets of study, and let
the priests rage at their leisure. Or, if you think they
are plotting your ruin, employ stratagem. Let your
friends at court obtain some embassy for you from the
king, and under that pretext leave France.<a id="FNanchor_627" href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">627</a> Think,
dear Berquin, think constantly what a hydra you are
attacking, and by how many mouths it spits its venom.
Your enemy is immortal, for a faculty never dies.
You will begin by attacking three monks only; but
you will raise up against you numerous legions, rich,
mighty, and perverse. Just now the princes are for
you; but backbiters will contrive to alienate their
affection. As for me, I declare I will have nothing
to do with the Sorbonne and its armies of monks.’</p>

<p>This letter disturbed Berquin. He read it again
and again, and each time his trouble increased. He
an ambassador ... he the representative of the king
at foreign courts! Ah! when Satan tempted Christ
he offered him the kingdoms of this world. Better be
a martyr on the Gr&egrave;ve for the love of the Saviour!
Berquin separated from Erasmus. ‘His spirit,’ said
his friends, ‘resembles a palm-tree; the more you desire
to bend it, the straighter it grows.’ A trifling
circumstance contributed to strengthen his decision.</p>

<p>One day Beda, syndic of the Sorbonne, went to
court, where he had some business to transact with
the king on behalf of that body. Some time before,
he had published a refutation of the ‘Paraphrases and
Annotations’ of Erasmus, and Francis I., who boasted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_544">544</span>
of being a pupil of this king of letters, having heard of
Beda’s attack, had given way to a fit of passion. As
soon, therefore, as he heard that Beda was in the palace,
he gave orders that he should be arrested and kept
prisoner. Accordingly the syndic was seized, shut up
in a chamber, and closely watched. Beda was exasperated,
and the hatred he felt against the Reformation
was turned against the king. Some of his friends,
on hearing of this strange adventure, conjured Francis
to set him at liberty. He consented on the following
day, but on condition that the syndic should appear
when called for.<a id="FNanchor_628" href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">628</a></p>

<p>The Sorbonne, said Berquin to himself, represents
the papacy. It must be overthrown in order that
Christ may triumph. He began first to study the
writings of Beda, who had so bitterly censured
those of his adversaries, and extracted from them
twelve propositions ‘manifestly impious and blasphemous’
in the opinion of Erasmus. Then, taking his
manuscript, he proceeded to court and presented it
to the king, who said: ‘I will interdict Beda’s polemical
writings.’ As Francis smiled upon him, Berquin
resolved to go further, namely, to attack the
Sorbonne and popery, as equally dangerous to the
State and to the Church, and to make public certain
doctrines of theirs which struck at the power of the
throne. He approached the king, and said to him
in a lower tone: ‘Sire, I have discovered in the acts
and papers of the Sorbonne certain secrets of importance
to the State ... some mysteries of iniquity.’<a id="FNanchor_629" href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">629</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_545">545</span>
Nothing was better calculated to exasperate Francis I.
‘Show me those passages,’ he exclaimed. Meantime
he told the reformer that the twelve propositions of
the syndic of the Sorbonne should be examined. Berquin
left the palace full of hope. ‘I will follow these
redoubtable hornets into their holes,’ he said to his
friends. ‘I will fall upon these insensate babblers,
and scourge them on their own dunghill.’ Some
people who heard him thought him out of his mind.
‘This gentleman will certainly get himself put to
death,’ they said, ‘and he will richly deserve it.’<a id="FNanchor_630" href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">630</a></p>

<p>Everything seemed to favour Berquin’s design.
Francis I. was acting the part of Frederick the Wise:
he seemed even more ardent than that moderate protector
of Luther. On the 12th of July, 1527, the
Bishop of Bazas appeared at court, whither he had
been summoned by the king. Francis gave him the
twelve famous propositions he had received from Berquin,
and commanded him to take them to the rector
of the university, with orders to have them examined,
not only by doctors of divinity, of whom he had
suspicions in such a matter,<a id="FNanchor_631" href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">631</a> but by the four assembled
faculties. Berquin hastened to report this to Erasmus,
still hoping to gain him over by the good news.</p>

<p>Erasmus had never before felt so alarmed; he tried
to stop Berquin in his ‘mad’ undertaking. The eulogies
which this faithful christian lavished upon him
particularly filled him with terror; he would a thousand
times rather they had been insults. ‘The love which
you show for me,’ he wrote to Berquin, ‘stirs up unspeakable
hatred against me everywhere. The step
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_546">546</span>
you have taken with the king will only serve to irritate
the hornets. You wish for a striking victory rather
than a sure one; your expectations will be disappointed;
the Bedists are contriving some atrocious
plot.<a id="FNanchor_632" href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">632</a> ... Beware!... Even should your cause
be holier than that of Christ himself, your enemies
have resolved to put you to death. You say
that the king protects you ... do not trust to that;
the favour of princes is short-lived. You do not care
for your life, you add; good! but think at least of
learning, and of our friends who, alas! will perish
with you.’</p>

<p>Berquin was grieved at this letter. In his opinion
the moment was unparalleled. If Erasmus, Francis I.,
and Berquin act in harmony, no one can resist them;
France, and perhaps Europe, will be reformed. And
it is just when the King of France is stretching out
his hand that the scholar of Rotterdam draws his
back!... What can be done without Erasmus?...
A circumstance occurred, however, which gave some
hope to the evangelist.</p>

<p>The Sorbonne, little heeding the king’s opposition,
persevered in their attacks upon learning. They
forbade the professors in the colleges to read the
‘Colloquies’ of Erasmus with their pupils, and excommunicated
the king of the schools in the schools
themselves.... Erasmus, who was a vain, susceptible,
choleric man, will now unite with Berquin: the latter
had no doubt of it. ‘The time is come,’ wrote Berquin
to the illustrious scholar; ‘let us pull off the
mask behind which these theologians hide themselves.’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_547">547</span>
But the more Berquin urged Erasmus, the more
Erasmus shrank back; he wished for peace at any
cost. It was of no use to point to the blows which
the Sorbonne were aiming at him; it pleased him to be
beaten, not from meekness, but from fear of the world.
The wary man, who was now growing old, became impatient,
not against his slanderers, but against his
friend. His ‘son’ wanted to lead him as if he were
his master. He replied with sadness, almost with
bitterness: ‘Truly I admire you, my dear Berquin.
You imagine, then, that I have nothing else to do
than spend my days in battling with theologians....
I would rather see all my books condemned to the
flames than go fighting at my age.’ Unhappily, Erasmus
did not abandon his books only, he abandoned
truth; and there he was wrong. Berquin did not
despair of victory, and undertook to win it unaided.
He thought to himself: ‘Erasmus admires in the Gospel
a certain harmony with the wisdom of antiquity,
but he does not adore in it the foolishness of the cross;
he is a theorist, not a reformer.’ From that hour
Berquin wrote more rarely and more coldly to his
illustrious master, and employed all his strength to
carry by main force the place he was attacking. If
Erasmus, like Achilles, had retired to his tent, were
not Margaret and Francis, and Truth especially, fighting
by his side?</p>

<p>The catholic party grew alarmed, and resolved to
oppose a vigorous resistance to these attacks. The
watchword was given. Many libels were circulated;
men were threatened with the gaol and the stake;
even ghosts were conjured up; all means were lawful.
One sister Alice quitted the fires of purgatory and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_548">548</span>
appeared on the banks of the Rhone and Saone to confound
‘the damnable sect of heretics.’ Any one might
read of this prodigy in the ‘Marvellous History of the
Ghost of Lyons,’ written by one of the king’s almoners.
The Sorbonne knew, however, that phantoms were not
sufficient; but they had on their side something more
than phantoms. They could oppose Berquin with
adversaries who had flesh and blood like himself, and
whose power seemed irresistible. These adversaries
were a princess and a statesman.

<span class="small">EFFORTS OF DUPRAT TO BRING ABOUT A PERSECUTION:
RESISTANCE OF FRANCIS I.<br />

(1527-1528.)</span></h2>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">A woman</span> reigned in the councils of the king.
Inclined at first to ridicule the monks, she had
after the defeat of Pavia gone over to the side of the
priests. At the moment when the kingly authority
received such a blow, she had seen that their power
remained, and had made them her auxiliaries. This
woman was Louisa of Savoy, Duchess of Angoul&ecirc;me,
mother of Francis I., worthy predecessor of Catherine
de’ Medici. A clever woman, ‘an absolute lady in
her wishes both good and bad,’ says Pasquier; a freethinker,
who could study the new doctrine as a curiosity,
but who despised it; a dissolute woman, of whom
Beaucaire, Brant&ocirc;me, and others relate many scandalous
anecdotes; a fond and absolute mother, who all
her life preserved an almost sovereign authority over
her son,&mdash;Louisa held in her hand two armies which
she managed at will. One of these was composed of
her maids of honour, by whose means she introduced
into the court of France gallantry, scandal, and even
indecency of language; the other was formed of intelligent,
crafty men, who had no religion, no morality,
no scruples; and at their head was Duprat.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_550">550</span></p>

<p>The latter was the patron upon whom the Sorbonne
thought they could rely. Enterprising and systematic,
at once supple and firm, slavish and tyrannical, an
intriguer and debauchee, often exasperated, never
discouraged, ‘very clever, knowing, and subtle,’ says
the <i>Bourgeois de Paris</i>; ‘one of the most pernicious
men that ever lived,’ says another historian:<a id="FNanchor_633" href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">633</a> Duprat
sold offices, ground the people down, and if any of them
remonstrated against his disorders, he sent the remonstrants
to the Bastille.<a id="FNanchor_634" href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">634</a> This man, who was archbishop
of Sens and cardinal, and who aspired to be
made legate <i>a latere</i>, having become a prince of the
Roman Church, placed at its service his influence, his
iron will, and even his cruelty.</p>

<p>But nothing could be done without the king.
Louisa of Savoy and the cardinal, knowing his fickleness
and his love of pleasure, and knowing also that
in religious matters he cared only for pomp and
ceremony, hoped to induce him easily to oppose the
Reformation. Yet Francis hesitated and even resisted.
He pretended to have a great taste for letters, of which
the Gospel, in his eyes, formed part. He yielded
willingly to his sister, who pleaded warmly the cause
of the friends of the Gospel. He detested the arrogance
of the priests. The boldness with which they
put forward ultramontane ideas; set another power
(the power of the pope) above his; attacked his
ideas in conversations, pamphlets, and even in the
pulpit; their restless character, their presumptuous
confidence in the triumph of their cause,&mdash;all this
irritated one of the most susceptible monarchs that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_551">551</span>
ever reigned; and he was pleased at seeing a man like
Berquin take down the boasting of the clergy.</p>

<p>Yet it may well be that the king was influenced by
higher motives. He saw the human mind displaying
a fresh activity in every direction. The literary, the
philosophical, the political, the religious world were
all undergoing important transformations in the first
half of the sixteenth century. In the midst of all
these different movements, Francis I. may have sometimes
had a confused feeling that there was one which
was the mainspring, the dominant fact, the generating
principle, and, if I may use the words, the <i>fiat lux</i> of
the new creation. He saw that the Reformation was
the great force then acting in the world; that all
others were subordinate to it; that to it belonged,
according to an ancient prophecy, <i>the gathering of the
people</i>;<a id="FNanchor_635" href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">635</a> and in these moments, when his sight was
clear, he wished to join himself to that invisible power
which was effecting more than all the other powers.
Unfortunately his passions soon disturbed his sight,
and after having caught a glimpse of the day, he
plunged back again into night.</p>

<p>As for Duprat he felt no hesitation; he resolutely
put himself on the side of darkness, impelled by
ambition and covetousness: he was always with the
ultramontanists. The struggle was about to begin
between the better aspirations of the king and the
plots of the court of Rome. It was hard to say with
which of these two powers the victory would ultimately
remain. The chancellor-cardinal had, however,
no doubt about it; he arranged the attack with skill,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_552">552</span>
and thought he had hit upon a way, as vile as it was
sure, of checking the Reform.</p>

<p>The king had to provide for the heavy charges
which the treaty of Madrid imposed upon him, and
he had no money. He applied to the clergy. ‘Good!’
said they; ‘let us take advantage of the opportunity
given us.’ They furnished 1,300,000 livres, but demanded
in return, according to Duprat’s suggestion,
that his Majesty ‘should extirpate the damnable and
insupportable Lutheran sect which some time since
had secretly crept into the kingdom.’<a id="FNanchor_636" href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">636</a> The king, who
wanted money, would be ready to grant everything
in order to fill his coffers; it seemed, then, that all
was over not only with Berquin, but with the Reformation.</p>

<p>Margaret, who was then at Fontainebleau with the
King of Navarre, heard of the demand the clergy had
made to the king, and trembled lest Francis should
deliver up her friends to the persecutions of the
cardinal. She immediately endeavoured to exercise
over her brother that influence to which in those
days he yielded readily. She succeeded: the king,
although putting the contribution of the clergy into
his treasury, did not order ‘the extirpation of the
Lutheran heresy.’</p>

<p>Yet Margaret did not feel secure. She experienced
the keenest anguish at the thought of the danger
which threatened the Gospel.

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">True God of heaven, give comfort to my soul!<br /></span>
</span></span>

she said in one of her poems. Her soul was
comforted. The aged Lef&egrave;vre, who was at that time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_553">553</span>
translating the Bible and the homilies of St. Chrysostom
on the Acts of the Apostles, and teaching his
young pupil, the Duke of Angoul&ecirc;me, to learn the
Psalms of David by heart, rekindled her fire, and
with his failing voice strengthened her in the faith.
‘Do not be afraid,’ he said; ‘the election of God is
very mighty.’<a id="FNanchor_637" href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">637</a>&mdash;‘Let us pray in faith,’ said Roussel;
‘the main thing is that faith should accompany our
prayers.’ The friends at Strasburg entreated Luther
to strengthen her by some good letter. As soon as
Erasmus heard of the danger which the Gospel ran,
he was moved, and, with the very pen with which he
had discouraged Berquin, he wrote:</p>

<p>‘O queen, still more illustrious by the purity of
your life than by the splendour of your race and
of your crown, do not fear! He who works everything
for the good of those whom he loves, knows
what is good for us, and, when he shall judge fit, will
suddenly give a happy issue to our affairs.<a id="FNanchor_638" href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">638</a> It is
when human reason despairs of everything that the
impenetrable wisdom of God is made manifest in all its
glory. Nothing but what is happy can befall the man
who has fixed the anchor of his hopes on God. Let
us place ourselves wholly in his hands. But what am
I doing?... I know, Madame, that it is not necessary
to excite you by powerful incentives, and that we ought
rather to thank you for having protected from the
malice of wicked men sound learning and all those
who sincerely love Jesus Christ.’<a id="FNanchor_639" href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">639</a></p>

<p>The queen’s condition tended erelong to give a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_554">554</span>
new direction to her thoughts. She hoped for a
daughter, and often spoke about it in her letters. This
daughter was indeed given her, and she became the
most remarkable woman of her age. Calm and somewhat
dejected, Margaret, who was then living alone in
the magnificent palace of Fontainebleau, sought diversion
in the enjoyment of the beauties of nature, during
her daily walks in the park and the forest. ‘My
condition,’ she wrote on the 27th of September, 1527,
‘does not prevent my visiting the gardens twice a day,
where I am wonderfully at my ease.’ She walked
slowly, thinking of the child about to be given her,
and rejoicing in the light of the sun. Then reverting
to him who held the chief place in her heart, she
called to mind the true sun (Jesus Christ), and,
grieving that his rays did not enlighten the whole of
France, exclaimed:</p>

<p>It seems that Margaret’s presence near the king
checked the persecutors; but she was soon compelled
to leave the field open. The time of her confinement
drew near. Henry d’Albret had not visited Bearn
since his marriage; perhaps he desired that his child
should be born in the castle of Pau. In October
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_555">555</span>
1527 the King and Queen of Navarre set out for their
possessions in the Pyrenees.<a id="FNanchor_641" href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">641</a> On the 7th of January,
two months later, Jeanne d’Albret was born; the
statement that she was born at Fontainebleau or at
Blois is a mistake.</p>

<p>The Queen of Navarre had hardly left for Bearn,
when Duprat and the Sorbonne endeavoured to carry
their cruel plans into execution. Among the number
of the gentlemen of John Stuart, Duke of Albany,
was a nobleman of Poitou named De la Tour. The
Duke of Albany, a member of the royal family of
Scotland, had been regent of that kingdom, and De
la Tour had lived with him in Edinburgh, where he
had made the most of his time. ‘When the lord duke
was regent of Scotland,’ people said, ‘the Sieur de
la Tour sowed many Lutheran errors there.’<a id="FNanchor_642" href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">642</a> This
French gentleman must therefore have been one of
the earliest reformers in Scotland. He showed no
less zeal at Paris than at Edinburgh, which greatly
displeased the priests. Moreover, the Duke of Albany,
who was in high favour with the king, was much
disliked by the ambitious chancellor. An indictment
was drawn up; Francis I., whose good genius
was no longer by his side, shut his eyes; De la Tour
and his servant, an evangelical like himself, were
condemned by the parliament for heresy. On the
27th of October these two pious christians were bound
in the same cart and led slowly to the pig-market to
be burnt alive. When the cart stopped, the executioners
ordered the servant to get down. He did so
and stood at the cart’s tail. They stripped off his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_556">556</span>
clothes, and flogged him so long and so severely that
the poor wretch declared that he ‘repented.’ Some
little mercy was consequently shown him, and they
were content to cut out his tongue. They hoped by
this means to shake De la Tour’s firmness; but though
deeply moved, he raised his eyes to heaven, vowed to
God that he would remain true to him, and immediately
an ineffable joy replaced the anguish by which
he had been racked. He was burnt alive.</p>

<p>Margaret must have heard at Pau of the death of
the pious De la Tour; but however that may be, she
left for Paris immediately after her delivery, giving
her people orders to make haste. What was it that
recalled her so promptly to the capital? Was it the
news of some danger threatening the Gospel? A
council was about to assemble at Paris; did she desire
to be at hand to ward off the blows aimed at her
friends? That is the reason given by one historian.<a id="FNanchor_643" href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">643</a>
‘She had determined to make haste,’ and, her confinement
scarcely over, this weak and delicate princess,
urging her courier to press on, crossed the sands and
marshes of the Landes. In a letter from Barbezieux,
she complains of the bad roads by which her carriage
was so roughly jolted. ‘I can find nothing difficult,
nor any stage wearisome. I hope to be at Blois in
ten days.’<a id="FNanchor_644" href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">644</a></p>

<p>It was time. De la Tour’s death had satisfied
neither the chancellor nor the Sorbonne. They desired
‘the extirpation of heresy,’ and not merely the death of
a single heretic. Not having succeeded by means of
the clergy tax, they were determined to strive for it in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_557">557</span>
another manner. Duprat listened to the reports, and
took note of what he observed in the streets. Nothing
annoyed him so much as hearing of laymen, and even
women, who turned away their heads as they passed
the churches, slipped into lonely streets, met in cellars
or in garrets, where persons who had not received
holy orders prayed aloud and read the Holy Scriptures.
Had he not in 1516 abrogated the pragmatic
sanction and stripped the Gallican Church of its liberties?
Would he not, therefore, succeed with far less
trouble in sacrificing this new and free Church, a poor
and contemptible flock? As a provincial council was
to be held at Paris, Duprat resolved to take advantage
of it to strike a decisive blow.</p>

<p>On the 28th of February, 1528, the council was
opened. The cardinal-archbishop having gone thither
in great pomp, rose and spoke amid dead silence:
‘Sirs, a terrible pestilence, stirred up by Martin
Luther, has destroyed the orthodox faith. A tempest
has burst upon the bark of St. Peter, which, tossed
by the winds, is threatened with dreadful shipwreck.<a id="FNanchor_645" href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">645</a> ...
There is no difference between Luther and
Manich&aelig;us.... And yet, reverend fathers, his adherents
multiply in our province; they hold secret
conventicles in many places; they unite with laymen
in the most private chambers of the houses;<a id="FNanchor_646" href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">646</a> they
discuss the catholic faith with women and fools.’ ...</p>

<p>It will be seen that it was not heresy, properly so
called, that the chancellor condemned in the Reformation,
but liberty. A religion which was not exclusively
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_558">558</span>
in the hands of priests was, in his eyes, more
alarming than heresy. If such practices were tolerated,
would they not one day see gentlemen, shopkeepers,
and even men sprung from the ranks of the
people, presuming to have something to say in matters
of state? The germ of the constitutional liberties of
modern times lay hid in the bosom of the Reformation.
The chancellor was not mistaken. He wished
at one blow to destroy both religious and political
liberty. He found enthusiastic accomplices in the
priests assembled at Paris. The council drew up a
decree ordering the bishops and even the inhabitants
of the dioceses to denounce all the Lutherans of their
acquaintance.</p>

<p>Would the king sanction this decree? Duprat was
uneasy. He collected his thoughts, arranged his
arguments, and proceeded to the palace with the hope
of gaining his master. ‘Sire,’ he said to Francis,
‘God is able without your help to exterminate all
this heretical band;<a id="FNanchor_647" href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">647</a> but, in his great goodness, he
condescends to call men to his aid. Who can
tell of the glory and happiness of the many princes
who, in past ages, have treated heretics as the greatest
enemies of their crowns, and have given them over to
death? If you wish to obtain salvation; if you wish
to preserve your sovereign rights intact; if you wish
to keep the nations submitted to you in tranquillity:
manfully defend the catholic faith, and subdue all
its enemies by your arms.’<a id="FNanchor_648" href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">648</a> Thus spoke Duprat;
but the king thought to himself that if his ‘sovereign
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_559">559</span>
rights’ were menaced at all, it might well be by the
power of Rome. He remained deaf as before.</p>

<p>‘Let us go further,’ said the chancellor to his creatures;
‘let the whole Church call for the extirpation
of heresy.’ Councils were held at Lyons, Rouen,
Tours, Rheims, and Bourges, and the priests restrained
themselves less in the provinces than in the capital.
‘These heretics,’ said the fiery orators, ‘worship the
devil, whom they raise by means of certain herbs and
sacrilegious forms.’<a id="FNanchor_649" href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">649</a> But all was useless; Francis took
pleasure in resisting the priests, and Duprat soon encountered
an obstacle not less formidable.</p>

<p>If it was the duty of the priests to denounce the
‘enchanters,’ it was the business of the parliament to
condemn them; but parliament and the chancellor
were at variance. On the death of his wife, Duprat,
then a layman and first president of parliament, had
calculated that this loss might be a gain, and he entered
the Church in order to get possession of the richest
benefices in the kingdom. First, he laid his hands on
the archbishopric of Sens, although at the election
there were twenty-two votes against him and only
one for him.<a id="FNanchor_650" href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">650</a> Shortly after that, he seized the rich
abbey of St. Benedict. ‘To us alone,’ said the monks,
‘belongs the choice of our abbot;’ and they boldly
refused to recognise the chancellor. Duprat’s only
answer was to lock them all up. The indignant parliament
sent an apparitor to the archbishop’s officers, and
ordered them to appear before it; but the officers
fell upon the messenger, and beat him so cruelly that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_560">560</span>
he died. The king decided in favour of his first
minister, and the difference between the parliament
and the chancellor grew wider.</p>

<p>Duprat, who desired to become reconciled with this
court, whose influence was often necessary to him,
fancied he could gain it over by means of the Lutheran
heresy, which they both detested equally. On their
side the parliament desired nothing better than to
recover the first minister’s favour. These intrigues
succeeded. ‘The chancellor and the counsellors mutually
gave up the truth, which they looked upon as
a mere nothing, like a crust of bread which one throws
to a dog,’ to use the words of a reformer. Great was
the exultation then in sacristy and in convent.</p>

<p>As chancellor, Sorbonne, and parliament were
agreed, it seemed impossible that the Reformation
should not succumb under their combined attacks.
They said to one another: ‘We must pluck up all
these <i>ill weeds</i>;’ but they did not require, however,
that it should be done in one day. ‘If the king
will only grant us some little isolated persecution,’
said the enemies of the Reform, ‘we will so work the
matter that all the grist shall come to the mill at last.’</p>

<p>But even that they could not obtain from the king;
the terrible mill remained idle and useless. The agitation
of the clergy was, in the opinion of Francis,
mere monkish clamour; he desired to protect learning
against the attacks of the ultramontanists. Besides,
he felt that the greatest danger which threatened
his authority was the theocratic power, and he feared
still more these restless and noisy priests. The
Reformation appeared to be saved, when an unexpected
circumstance delivered it over to its enemies.

<span class="small">REJOICINGS AT FONTAINEBLEAU AND THE VIRGIN OF THE
RUE DES ROSIERS.<br />

(1528.)</span></h2>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Everything</span> appeared in France to incline towards
peace and joy. The court was at Fontainebleau,
where Francis I. and the Duchess of
Angoul&ecirc;me, the King and Queen of Navarre, and all
the most illustrious of the nobility, had assembled to
receive the young Duke of Ferrara, who had just
arrived (20th of May, 1528) to marry Madame Ren&eacute;e,
daughter of Louis XII. and Anne of Brittany. It was
a time of rejoicing. Francis I., whose favourite residence
was Fontainebleau, had erected a splendid palace
there, and laid out ‘beautiful gardens, shrubberies,
fountains, and all things pleasant and recreative.’&mdash;‘Really,’
said the courtiers, ‘the king has turned a
wilderness into the most beautiful residence in christendom&mdash;so
spacious that you might lodge a little
world in it.’<a id="FNanchor_651" href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">651</a> Foreigners were struck with the
magnificence of the palace and the brilliancy of the
court. The marriage of the daughter of Louis XII.
was approaching: there was nothing but concerts and
amusements. There were excursions in the forest, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_562">562</span>
sumptuous banquets in the palace, and learned men
(says Brant&ocirc;me) discoursed at table on ‘the higher
and the lower sciences.’ But nothing attracted the attention
of the foreign visitors so much as the Queen of
Navarre. ‘I observed her,’ says a bishop, a papal legate,
‘while she was speaking to Cardinal d’Este, and I
admired in her features, her expression, and in every
movement, an harmonious union of majesty, modesty,
and kindness.’<a id="FNanchor_652" href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">652</a> Such was Margaret in the midst of
the court; the goodness of her heart, the purity of
her life, and the abundance of her works spoke eloquently
to those about her of the beauty of the
Gospel.</p>

<p>The princess, who was compelled to take part in
every court entertainment, never let an opportunity
pass of calling a soul to Jesus Christ. In the sixteenth
century there was no evangelist, among women
at least, more active than her; this is a trait too important
in the French Reformation to be passed by
unnoticed. The maids of honour of the Duchess of
Angoul&ecirc;me were no longer the virtuous damsels of
Queen Claude. Margaret, feeling the tenderest compassion
for these young women, called now one and
now another to Christ; she conjured her ‘dears’
(as she styled them) not to be ‘caught by pleasure,’
which would render them hateful to God.</p>

<p>Francis I., who loved the chase, would often go into
the forest, attended by his young lords, and hunt the
boar and deer for days together. These youths took
great pleasure in talking of their skill to the ladies of
the court, or in challenging one another who could
kill the finest stag.... The Queen of Navarre sometimes
joined good-naturedly in these conversations;
she would smilingly call these gay young lords ‘bad
sportsmen,’ and exhort them ‘to go a-hunting after
better game.’</p>

<p>Here is one of these conversations of Fontainebleau,
which she herself relates:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As a youth was riding one day to the wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He asked of a lady so wise and good<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If the game he sought for could be found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the forest that spread so thickly round;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the young man’s heart with desire beat high<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To kill the deer. The dame, with a sigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Replied: ‘It’s the season for hunters, ’tis true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But alas! no hunter true are you.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘In the wood where none but believers go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is the game you seek, but do not know;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is in that bitter wood of the cross<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which by the wicked is counted dross;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But to huntsmen good its taste is sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the pain it costs is the best of meat.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_564">564</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If that your mind were firmly set<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Every honour but this to forget,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No other game would be sought by you....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ... you are not a hunter true.’<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As he heard these words, the hunter blushed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with anger his countenance flushed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘You speak at random, dame,’ he cried;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘The stag will I have, and nought beside.’<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="center"><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘The stag you seek is close in view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ... you are not a hunter true.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Sit you down by the fountain’s brim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in patience wait for him;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, with soul and body at rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drink of that spring so pure and blest:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All other means but this are nought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For eager in the toils of your heart to be caught,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stag will come running up to you;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ... you are not a hunter true.’<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="center"><span class="smcap">The Young Hunter.</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘Dame, ’tis an idle tale you tell;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then the stag will never be caught by you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For ... you are not a hunter true.’<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The young hunter understands at last what is wanted
of him, and, after some further conversation with the
lady, he exclaims:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘With earnest faith my heart is filled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All my worldly thoughts I yield<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the voice of my Saviour Christ Jesu!’<br /></span>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_565">565</span>
</div></div>

<p>This narrative, and others of a like nature contained
in the <i>Marguerites</i>, were in all probability facts before
they became poems. The little ballads were circulated
at court; everybody wished to read the queen’s
‘tracts,’ and many of the nobility of France, who afterwards
embraced the cause of the Reform, owed their
first religious sentiments to Margaret.</p>

<p>For the moment, the great thought that occupied
every mind at Fontainebleau was the marriage of the
‘very prudent and magnificent Madame Ren&eacute;e.’ The
gentlemen of France and of Ferrara appeared at court
in sumptuous costumes; the princes and princesses
glittered with jewels; the halls and galleries were
hung with rich tapestry.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Dance and rejoice, make holiday<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>All of a sudden, on the morrow of Pentecost, a message
fell into the midst of this brilliant and joyous company
which excited the deepest emotion. A letter was
handed to the king, and the effect it produced was like
that occasioned by a clap of thunder in a cloudless sky.
Francis, who held the letter in his hand, was pale,
agitated, almost quivering, as if he had just received
a mortal insult. His anger exploded in an instant,
like a mountain pouring out torrents of lava. He
gave way to the most violent passion, and swore to
take a cruel revenge. Margaret, terrified by her
brother’s anger, did not say a word, but withdrew, in
alarm, to silence and prayer: she scarcely ventured an
attempt to calm her brother’s emotion. ‘The incensed
king,’ says the chronicler, ‘wept hard with vexation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_566">566</span>
and anger.’<a id="FNanchor_656" href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">656</a> The court f&ecirc;tes were interrupted:
the courtiers, joining in unison with their master,
called loudly for violent measures, and Francis departed
suddenly for Paris. What had caused all this
commotion?</p>

<p>The festival of Pentecost (Whitsunday) had been
celebrated with great pomp on the 30th of May,
1528; but the devotionists, neglecting the Father,
the Son, and above all the Holy Ghost, had thought
of nothing all the day long but of worshipping the
Virgin and her images. In the quarter of St. Antoine,
and at the angle still formed by the streets Des Rosiers
and Des Juifs, at the corner of the house belonging to
the Sire Loys de Harlay, stood an image of the Virgin
holding the infant Jesus in her arms. Numbers of
devout persons of both sexes went every day to kneel
before this figure. During the festival the crowd was
more numerous than ever, and, bowing before the
image, they lavished on it the loftiest of titles: ‘O holy
Virgin! O mediatress of mankind! O pardon of sinners!
Author of the righteousness which cleanses
away our sins! Refuge of all who return unto
God!’<a id="FNanchor_657" href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">657</a> These observances had bitterly grieved
those who remembered the old commandment: <i>Thou
shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt
thou serve</i>.</p>

<p>On the Monday morning, the morrow after the festival,
some passers-by fancied they observed something
wrong in the place where the image stood: they could
not see either the head of the Virgin or of the child.
The men approached, and found that both the heads
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_567">567</span>
had been cut off; they looked about for them, and
discovered them hidden behind a heap of stones close
by; they picked up in the gutter the Virgin’s robe,
which was torn and appeared to have been trampled
under foot. These persons, who were devout catholics,
felt alarmed; they respectfully took up the two
heads and carried them to the magistrate. The news
of the strange event quickly spread through the quarter.
Monks and priests mingled with the crowd, and described
the injury done to the image. Men, women,
and children surrounded the mutilated figure&mdash;some
weeping, others groaning, all cursing the sacrilege.
A ‘complaint’ of the times has handed down to us
the groans of the people:

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Alas! how great the woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And crime that cannot pardoned be!...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To have hurt Our Lady so,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lady full of charity,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to sinners ever kind!<a id="FNanchor_658" href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">658</a> ...<br /></span>
</span></span>

Such were the sentiments of the good catholics
who, with tearful eyes and troubled hearts, looked
upon the mutilated image.</p>

<p>Who were the authors of this mutilation? It was
never known. It has been said that the priests,
alarmed at the progress of the Reformation and the
disposition of the king, had perpetrated the act, in
order to use it as a weapon against the Lutherans.
That is possible, for such things have been done. I
am, however, more inclined to believe that some hot-headed
member of the evangelical party, exasperated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_568">568</span>
at hearing that attributed to the Virgin which belongs
only to Christ, had broken the idol. Be that as it
may, the fanatical party resolved to profit by the
sacrilege, and they succeeded.</p>

<p>Francis I., the most susceptible and most irritable
of princes, considered this act of violence as an outrage
upon his dignity and authority. As soon as he
reached Paris, he did everything in his power to
discover the guilty party. For two whole days heralds
paraded the streets, and stopping at the crossways
summoned the people by sound of trumpet and proclaimed:
‘If any one knows who has done this, let
him declare it to the magistrates and the king; the
provost of Paris will pay him a thousand gold crowns,
and if the informer has committed any crime, the king
will pardon him.’ The crowd listened and then dispersed;
but all was of no use. Nothing could be
learnt about it. ‘Very well, then,’ said the king, ‘I
will order commissioners to go and make inquiry at
every house.’ The commissioners went and knocked
at every door, examining one after another all the
inhabitants of the quarter; but the result was still
the same: ‘No one knew anything about it.’</p>

<p>The priests were not satisfied with these proclamations.
On Tuesday the 2nd of June, and during the
rest of the week, the clergy of Paris set themselves in
motion, and constant processions from all the churches
in the city marched to the scene of the outrage. A
week after, on Tuesday the 9th of June, five hundred
students, each carrying a lighted taper, with all the
doctors, licentiates, and bachelors of the university,
proceeded from the Sorbonne. In front of them
marched the four mendicant orders.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_569">569</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Beautiful it was to see<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>The reaction was complete. Learning and the
Gospel were forgotten; men thought only of honouring
the holy Virgin. The king, the Dukes of Ferrara,
Longueville, and Vend&ocirc;me, and even the King of
Navarre, desired to pay the greatest honour to Mary;
and accordingly on Thursday the 11th of June, being
Corpus Christi Day, a long procession left the palace
of the Tournelles.</p>

<span class="i0">A crowd of priests came chanting,<br /></span>

<p>The different guilds, supreme courts, bishops, ambassadors,
high officers of the crown, and princes of
the blood, were all present. They walked to the
sound of hautboys, clarions, and trumpets, playing
with great state. When the procession arrived at the
ill-omened spot, the king devoutly went up to it, and
fell on his knees and prayed. On rising, he received
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_570">570</span>
from the hands of his grand almoner a small silver-gilt
statue of the Virgin, which he piously set up in
the room of the former one, and placed his taper before
the image as a testimony of his faith. All the members
of the procession did the same, as they marched
past to the sound of the trumpets. The people manifested
their joy by acclamations:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Long live the king of fleur-de-lys<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all his noble family!<br /></span>

<p>Erelong the mutilated image, removed to the
church of St. Germain, began to work miracles. Four
days afterwards, a child having been brought into the
world still-born,

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">

</span></span>

The infant changed colour, adds the chronicle; it
was baptised, and, after it had returned its soul to
God, was buried. The miracle, it is clear, did not
last long.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all these tapers, miracles, and
trumpet sounds, the king was still excited. Neither
he nor the fanatics were satisfied. The flush which
some fancied they saw on the cheeks of the poor
little still-born child, was not sufficient; they wanted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_571">571</span>
a deeper red&mdash;red blood. Duprat, the Sorbonne, and
the parliament said that their master had at last
come to his senses, and that they must take advantage
of the change. Francis, who held the reins
firmly, had hitherto restrained the coursers bound
to his chariot. But now, irritated and inflamed,
he leant forward, slackened the bit, and even
urged them on with his voice. These fiery wild
horses were about to trample under foot all who
came in their way, and the wheels of his chariot,
crushing the unhappy victims, would sprinkle their
blood even upon the garments of the prince.</p>

<p>The persecution began.

<span class="small">PRISONERS AND MARTYRS AT PARIS AND IN THE PROVINCES.<br />

(1528.)</span></h2>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">There</span> lived in Paris one of those poor christians
of Meaux known as <i>christaudins</i>, or disciples
of Christ. This man, full of admiration for the Son
of God and of horror for images, had been driven
from his native city by persecution, and had become a
waterman on the Seine. One day a stranger entered
his boat, and as the Virgin was everywhere the subject
of conversation, since the affair of the Rue des Rosiers,
the passenger began to extol the power of the ‘mother
of God,’ and pulling out a picture of Mary, offered it
to his conductor. The boatman, who was rowing
vigorously, stopped; he could not contain himself,
and, taking the picture, said sharply: ‘The Virgin
Mary has no more power than this bit of paper,’
which he tore in pieces and threw into the river.
The exasperated catholic did not say a word; but as
soon as he landed, he ran off to denounce the heretic.
This time at least they knew the author of the sacrilege.
Who could tell but it was he who committed the
outrage in the Rue des Rosiers? The poor <i>christaudin</i>
was burnt on the Gr&egrave;ve at Paris.<a id="FNanchor_660" href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">660</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_573">573</span></p>

<p>All the evangelical christians of Meaux had not,
like him, quitted La Brie. In the fields around that
city might often be seen a pious man named Denis, a
native of Rieux. He had heard the divine summons
one day, and, filled with desire to know God, he had
come to Jesus. Deeply impressed with the pangs
which the Saviour had endured in order to save sinners,
he had from that hour turned his eyes unceasingly
upon the Crucified One. Denis was filled with
astonishment when he saw christians putting their
trust in ceremonies, instead of placing it wholly in
Christ. When, in the course of his many journeys,
he passed near a church at the time they were saying
mass, it seemed to him that he was witnessing a
theatrical representation<a id="FNanchor_661" href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">661</a> and not a religious act.
His tortured soul uttered a cry of anguish. ‘To
desire to be reconciled with God by means of a
mass,’ he said one day, ‘is to deny my Saviour’s
passion.’<a id="FNanchor_662" href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">662</a> The parliament gave orders to confine
Denis in the prison at Meaux.</p>

<p>As Bri&ccedil;onnet was still at the head of the diocese,
the judges requested him to do all in his power to
bring back Denis to the fold. One day the doors of
the prison opened, and the bishop, at the summit of
honour but a backslider from the faith, stood in the
presence of the christian under the cross, but still
faithful. Embarrassed at the part he had to play,
Bri&ccedil;onnet hung his head, hesitated, and blushed; this
visit was a punishment imposed upon his cowardice.
‘If you retract,’ he said to Denis at last, ‘we will
set you at liberty, and you shall receive a yearly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_574">574</span>
pension.’ But Denis had marvellously engraven in
his heart, says the chronicler, that sentence delivered
by Jesus Christ: ‘Whosoever shall deny me
before men, him will I also deny before my Father
which is in heaven.’ Turning therefore an indignant
look upon Bri&ccedil;onnet, he exclaimed: ‘Would you be
so base as to urge me to deny my God?’ The unhappy
prelate, terrified at this address, fancied he heard his
own condemnation, and without saying a word fled
hastily from the dungeon. Denis was condemned to
be burnt alive.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of July, the town sergeants came to
the prison; they took Denis from his cell and bound
him to the hurdle they had brought with them.
Then, as if to add insult to torture, they pinioned
his arms and placed a wooden cross in his hands.
Drawing up on each side of him, they said: ‘See
now how he worships the wood of the cross!’ and
dragged the poor sufferer on his hurdle through the
streets. Some of the spectators, when they saw him
holding the piece of wood, exclaimed: ‘Truly, he is
converted!’ but the humble believer replied: ‘O
my friends! ... be converted to the true cross!’
The procession advanced slowly on account of the
crowd, and as they were passing near a pond from
which the water, swollen by the rains, was rushing
rapidly, Denis gave a struggle, the cross fell, and
‘went sailing down the stream.’ When the bigots
(as the chronicler terms them) saw the cross dancing
and floating upon the water, they rushed forward to
pull it out, but could not reach it. They came back
and avenged themselves ‘by insulting the poor sufferer
lying on the hurdle.’ The stake was reached at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_575">575</span>
last. ‘Gently,’ said the priests, ‘kindle only a small
fire, a very small fire, in order that it may last the
longer.’ They bound Denis to a balanced pole and
placed him on the fire, and when the heat had almost
killed him, they hoisted him into the air. As soon as
he had recovered his senses, they let him down again.
Three times was he thus lifted up and lowered, the
flames each time beginning their work anew. ‘Yet
all the time,’ says the chronicler, ‘he called upon the
name of God.’<a id="FNanchor_663" href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">663</a> At last he died.</p>

<p>Not at Paris only did the Roman party show itself
without mercy. The wishes of Duprat, of the Sorbonne,
and of the parliament were carried out in the
provinces; and wherever truth raised her head, persecution
appeared. In the principal church of the
small town of Annonay, there hung from the arched
roof a precious shrine, which the devout used to contemplate
every day with pious looks. ‘It contains
<i>the holy virtues</i>,’ said the priests. ‘The shrine is
full of mysterious relics which no one is allowed to
see.’ On Ascension Day, however, the <i>holy virtues</i>
were borne in great ceremony through the city.
Men, women, and children were eager to walk in the
procession, with their heads and feet bare, and in
their shirts. Some of them approached the shrine,
and kissed it, passing backwards and forwards beneath
it, almost as the Hindoos do when the idol of Juggernaut
is dragged through the midst of its worshippers.
At the moment when the <i>holy virtues</i>
passed through the castle, the gates turned of
themselves on their hinges, and all the prisoners
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_576">576</span>
were set at liberty, with the exception of the
Lutherans.</p>

<p>These silly superstitions were about to be disturbed.
A battle began around this mysterious shrine, and as
soon as one combatant fell, another sprang up in his
place.</p>

<p>The first was a grey friar, a doctor of divinity,
whom Crespin calls Stephen Machopolis: the latter
appears to be one of those names which the reformers
sometimes assumed. Stephen, attracted by the rumours
of the Reformation, had gone to Saxony and
heard Luther.<a id="FNanchor_664" href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">664</a> Having profited by his teaching, the
grey friar determined to go back to France, and Luther
recommended him to the counts of Mansfeld, who
supplied him with the means of returning to his
native country.<a id="FNanchor_665" href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">665</a></p>

<p>Stephen had scarcely arrived at Annonay before he
began to proclaim warmly the virtues of the Saviour
and of the Holy Ghost, and to inveigh against the <i>holy
virtues</i> hanging in the church. The priests tried to
seize him, but he escaped. In the meanwhile he had
talked much about the Gospel with one of his friends,
a cordelier like himself, Stephen R&eacute;nier by name.
The latter undertook, with still more courage than
his predecessor, to convert all these ignorant people
from their faith in ‘dead men’s bones’ to the living
and true God. The priests surprised the poor man,
cast him into prison, and conveyed him to Vienne in
Dauphiny, where the archbishop resided. R&eacute;nier preferred
being burnt alive to making any concession.<a id="FNanchor_666" href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">666</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_577">577</span></p>

<p>A pious and learned schoolmaster, named Jonas,
had already taken his place in Annonay, and spoke
still more boldly than the two Franciscans. He was
sent to prison in his turn, and made before the magistrates
‘a good and complete’ profession of faith. As
the priests and the archbishop now had Jonas locked
up, they hoped to be quiet at last.</p>

<p>But very different was the result: the two friars
and the schoolmaster having disappeared, all those
who had received the Word of life rose up and proclaimed
it. The Archbishop of Vienne could contain
himself no longer; it seemed to him as if evangelicals
sprang ready-armed from the soil, like the followers
of Cadmus in days of yore.&mdash;‘They are headstrong
and furious,’ said the good folks of Vienne.&mdash;‘Bring
them all before me,’ cried the archbishop. Twenty-five
evangelical christians were taken from Annonay
to the archiepiscopal city, and many of them, being
left indefinitely in prison, died of weakness and bad
treatment.</p>

<p>The death of a few obscure men did not satisfy the
ultramontanes: they desired a more illustrious victim,
the most learned among the nobles. Wherever
Berquin or other evangelicals turned their steps,
they encountered fierce glances and heard cries of
indignation. ‘What tyrannical madness! what plutonic
rage!’ called out the mob as they passed. Rascally
youths! imps of Satan! brands of hell! <i>vilenaille</i>
brimful of Leviathans! venomous serpents! servants
of Lucifer!’<a id="FNanchor_667" href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">667</a> This was the usual vocabulary.</p>

<p>Berquin, as he heard this torrent of insult, answered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_578">578</span>
not a word: he thought it his duty to let the storm
blow over, and kept himself tranquil and solitary before
God. Sometimes, however, his zeal caught fire;
there were sudden movements in his heart, as of a
wind tossing up the waves with their foamy heads;
but he struggled against these ‘gusts’ of the flesh;
he ordered his soul to be still, and erelong nothing
was left but some little ‘fluttering.’</p>

<p>While Berquin was silent before the tempest, Beda
and his party did all in their power to bring down the
bolt upon that haughty head which refused to bend
before them. ‘See!’ they said, as they described the
mutilation of Our Lady, ‘see to what our toleration of
heresy leads!... Unless we root it up entirely, it will
soon multiply and cover the whole country.’</p>

<p>The doctors of the Sorbonne and other priests went
out of their houses in crowds; they spread right and
left, buzzing in the streets, buzzing in the houses,
buzzing in the palaces. ‘These hornets,’ says a
chronicler, ‘make their tedious noise heard by all
they meet, and urge them on with repeated stings.’
‘Away with Berquin!’ was their cry.</p>

<p>His friends grew alarmed. ‘Make your escape!’
wrote Erasmus to him. ‘Make your escape!’ repeated
the friends of learning and of the Gospel around him.<a id="FNanchor_668" href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">668</a>
But Berquin thought that by keeping quiet he did all
that he ought to do. Flight he would have considered
a disgrace, a crime. ‘With God’s help,’ he said,
‘I shall conquer the monks, the university, and the
parliament itself.’<a id="FNanchor_669" href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">669</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_579">579</span></p>

<p>Such confidence exasperated the Sorbonne. Beda
and his followers stirred university and parliament,
city, court, and Church, heaven and earth.... Francis I.
was puzzled, staggered, and annoyed. At last, being
beset on every side, and hearing it continually
repeated that Berquin’s doctrines were the cause of
the outrage in the Rue des Rosiers, the king yielded,
believing, however, that he yielded but little: he consented
only that an inquiry should be opened against
Berquin. The wild beast leapt with joy. His prey
was not yet given to him; but he already foresaw the
hour when he would quench his thirst in blood.</p>

<p>A strange blindness is that of popery! The lessons
of history are lost upon it. So long as events are in
progress, men mistake both their causes and consequences.
The smoke that covers the battle-field,
during the struggle, does not permit us to distinguish
and appreciate the movements of the different armies.
But once the battle ended, the events accomplished,
intelligent minds discover the principles of the movements
and order of battle. Now, if there is any truth
which history proclaims, it is that christianity was
established in the world by pouring out the blood of
its martyrs. One of the greatest fathers of the West
has enunciated this mysterious law.<a id="FNanchor_670" href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">670</a> But the Rome
of the popes&mdash;and in this respect she paid her tribute
to human weakness&mdash;overlooked this great law. She
took no heed of the facts that ought to have enlightened
her. She did not understand that the blood
of these friends of the Gospel, which she was so eager
to spill, would be for modern times, as it had been for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_580">580</span>
ancient times, a seed of transformation. Imprudently
resuming the part played by the Rome of the emperors,
she put to death, one after another, those who professed
the everlasting Truth. But at the very moment
when the enemies of the Reform imagined they had
crushed it by getting rid of Berquin; at the moment
when the irritation of the king allowed the servants of
Christ to be dragged on hurdles, and when he authorised
torture, imprisonment, and the stake; at the
moment when all seemed destined to remain mute
and trembling&mdash;the true Reformer of France issued
unnoticed from a college of priests, and was about to
begin, in an important city of the kingdom, that work
which we have undertaken to narrate&mdash;a work which
for three centuries has not ceased, and never will cease,
to grow.</p>

<p>We shall attempt to describe the small beginnings
of this great work in the next volume.</p>

‘Pœn&aelig; vero atrocitatem remitti cupio.’ (<i>Calvin to Farel</i>, Aug. 26,
1553.) Calvin appears afterwards to have prevailed on his colleagues to
join him: ‘Genus mortis conati sumus mutare, sed frustra.’ ‘We endeavoured
to change the manner of his death, but in vain; why did we not
succeed? I shall defer telling you until I see you.’ (<i>Same to same</i>, Oct.
26, 1553.) Farel replied to Calvin, ‘By desiring to soften the severity
of his punishment you acted as a friend towards a man who is your

I found this MS. in the library at Berne (<i>Histoire Helv&eacute;tique</i>, v. 12).
It is entitled, <i>Histoire de la Ville de Gen&egrave;ve</i>, by J. Bonivard. The history
is not by Bonivard: it was copied at Berne in 1705 from an old MS.
in the possession of Ami Favre, first syndic. Although not known at
Geneva, it contains many important circumstances that Spon and Gautier
have omitted either from timidity or by order, says Haller. I shall call
it the Berne MS. v. 12.</p></div>

Bonivard places its origin in 1518, and writes <i>Eiguenots</i>. (<i>Chroniq.</i>
ii. p. 331.) The Registers of the Council have it under the date of 3rd of
May, 1520, and read <i>Eyguenots</i>. In 1521 we find in the trial of B.
Toquet, <i>Ayguinoctic&aelig; sect&aelig;</i>. (Galiffe, <i>Mat&eacute;riaux</i>, &amp;c. ii. p. 164.) We
come upon it later in 1526: <i>Traitre Eyguenot</i>. (Ibid. p. 506.) In the
same year: <i>Tu es Eguenot</i>. (Ibid. p. 508.) Lastly, Michel Roset in his
Chronicle (liv. i. ch. lxxxix.) generally writes <i>Huguenot</i>. In the sixteenth
century as well as in the nineteenth nicknames have often passed
from Geneva to France.</p></div>

The official Registers of the Council (Dec. 22) say: ‘Bandi&egrave;re
leading three or four boys.’ Syndic Balard, an eye-witness, says: ‘Bandi&egrave;re,
accompanied by the children of some of those who have retired to
Germany.’ (<i>Journal</i>, p. 34.) Bonivard says the same, <i>Chroniq.</i> ii. p. 435.
It is therefore a mistake in a writer, otherwise very learned in the history
of Geneva, to say that: ‘There was not a single little child with him.’
(Galiffe, <i>Mat&eacute;riaux</i>, &amp;c. ii. p. 334.) His son did not fall into the same
error. (Galiffe fils, <i>Besan&ccedil;on Hugues</i>, p. 277.)</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
